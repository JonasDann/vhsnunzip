{\pard \plain \s0 \qj The Hunt\par }
{\pard \plain \s1 \outlinelevel0 \fs36 \b @\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj After rereading the first 23 Animorphs books, I got inspired to write my own. I did it mostly for myself, but I figured I might as well share it, right?\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj Since #some of the real Animorphs books were ghostwritten, I found it interesting to try to mimic the style of the original books as well. I don\rquote t have a style of my own, anyway, as this is the first serious thing I\rquote ve ever written. There\rquote s no modernization, no weird characters (in fact there aren\rquote t any new characters at all), the plot isn\rquote t crazier than the real books, etcetera. If I succeeded in my goals, it should read just like an original Animorphs book. I think I did, otherwise I wouldn\rquote t even bother posting this, but I\rquote ll leave it up to you to decide.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj Continuity-wise, the story starts after book 22 (the David arc). I don\rquote t know how many more books can fit between 22 and this story exactly, because I never read past 23 yet. I can tell you with absolute certainty though, that it does not join back into the canon continuity.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj ---\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj Update: I\rquote ve since continued writing, so there are sequels now. I also went back and fixed some spelling mistakes in {\i The Hunt} here and there, including two embarrassing name mix-ups\'85\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj Note that while I explicitly advertised {\i The Hunt} as having no #OCs, {\i The Anomaly} introduces some. So, should #OCs really not be your thing, you might want to stop after this story. I promise they\rquote re not flat or self-inserts, though.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj The series so far:\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj 1: {\i \ul The Hunt}{\ul  (Rachel)}\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj 2: {\i The Anomaly} (Cassie)\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj 3: {\i The Rescue} (Jake)\par }

{\pard \plain \s1 \outlinelevel0 \fs36 \b Chapter 1\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj My name is Rachel. That\rquote s all, just Rachel.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj I have a last name, of course. But I\rquote m not going to tell you. I\rquote m also not going to tell you where I live. See, I have some very powerful enemies. Telling you who I am would make it way too easy for them to find my friends.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj Not that it would be all that difficult to find out who I am after I\rquote ve told you my story, if you\rquote re one of my enemies or turn into one later. But I\rquote m at least not going to make it obvious.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj I\rquote m sure I sound like I\rquote m either paranoid or involved with the mafia or something. It\rquote s not the latter. Maybe a #little bit of the former. But I\rquote d say that's healthy for someone in my position.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj My friends all say I\rquote m fearless. Marco keeps calling me \ldblquote Xena: Warrior Princess\rdblquote . I\rquote m still not entirely sure whether he\rquote s trying to flatter or mock me, but I guess it\rquote s not that far off. Except I\rquote m younger, blond, I try to dress sanely, and I\rquote m not quite fearless. Especially not now that my family is involved.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj I just don\rquote t like showing my fear.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj But right then, I really wasn\rquote t scared. I was right in my natural habitat: the mall.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj \ldblquote I\rquote m not sure about this,\rdblquote  Cassie said, holding what must be the millionth dress I picked out for her in front of her.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj Cassie\rquote s my best friend. You wouldn\rquote t think so, though. Cassie hates shopping, and she normally really does not care about how she looks. You\rquote ll almost always find her in a torn-up pair of jeans about two sizes too small, an old stained shirt, and boots. Not stylish boots, mind you, but the kind that you wear when you know you\rquote re going to be walking around in a combination of mud, hay, and animal poo. #Which is normally {\i where} you\rquote ll find Cassie. That's {\i her} natural habitat.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj But recently she\rquote s started to care a bit more. She and my cousin Jake have a thing. Neither of them will admit to anything, but it\rquote s painfully obvious.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj She tried to be casual about it when she asked me to help her buy some new clothes. Her excuse was that she just needs new clothes because, well, we go through clothes a bit quicker than your average teenager. But when we got to the mall, she kept eyeing the more fancy sections. And all the while she was blushing.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj I\rquote d made it sound like it was my idea. \ldblquote Maybe you should get something nicer this time. How about a dress?\rdblquote  I\rquote d said. She\rquote d have denied everything and gotten something plain otherwise. And what can I say, they\rquote re cute together.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj \ldblquote It just doesn\rquote t seem very practical,\rdblquote  Cassie added.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj \ldblquote This particular dress or a dress in general?\rdblquote  I asked, getting just a #little bit desperate.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj But Cassie just stared off into the distance. If we were just your normal everyday teens, you\rquote d think she was just worried Jake wouldn\rquote t like it. But we\rquote re not everyday teens. More likely, she was worrying about having to run for her life while wearing it, or something of the sort. After all, those powerful enemies of mine are hers as well.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj \ldblquote Why don\rquote t you try it on? I\rquote m sure it\rquote ll look good on you,\rdblquote  I added, trying to distract her from those thoughts. We all get them, but we can\rquote t let them rule our lives.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj After another second of staring she blinked, sighed, and looked at me again.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj \ldblquote Okay, fine. No harm in that.\rdblquote \par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj Then, just as we started heading for the changing rooms, a Hork-Bajir burst out of one of them.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj Literally burst. Hork-Bajir are bigger than humans, a lot stronger, and a {\i lot} sharper. The thin wooden walls separating the changing rooms never stood a chance. Fortunately, the adjoining changing rooms were empty.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj I guess I should back up a little and explain.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj Earth is under attack from aliens called Yeerks. It has been for a couple of years. But no one who has even the slightest chance of doing something about it knows. Except for my friends and me, but our chances aren\rquote t all that great, either.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj If I would just show you a Yeerk, you probably wouldn\rquote t be very scared of it. You\rquote d be disgusted by it, maybe. They don\rquote t look very impressive, they\rquote re just gray slugs. Somewhat larger than normal Earth slugs, but not enough to be worried about it. You could easily squash it under your foot if you wanted to.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj And if you knew what it was, you\rquote d want to.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj Yeerks are parasites. Sentient parasites. But they don\rquote t just live off of other beings like Earth parasites do. They live {\i as} them. Their little gimmick is that they can get inside your head and control you. Literally inside. They enter through your ears and then wrap themselves around your brain somehow. And literally control. It takes them a couple minutes to figure out how your brain works, but after that, their control is absolute.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj With a Yeerk inside your head, you no longer control your arms or legs. You no longer control your mouth or vocal cords. You no longer control what your senses focus on. #You become what we call a Controller.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj #You can still think for yourself though. The Yeerk can\rquote t control that, not directly anyway. But that just makes it all the more horrifying. #Because that means you know what\rquote s going on. What the Yeerk is doing with your body. It could make you hurt your friends and family, and laugh at you while it\rquote s doing it. And you can\rquote t even look away.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj You become the embodiment of helplessness.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj But what it can\rquote t control, it can observe. It can read all your thoughts, memories, and emotions like an open book. That\rquote s why I can\rquote t tell you who I am. Not only is there no good way for me to be sure that you\rquote re not a Controller right now, but even if I could be, the moment the Yeerks decide to target you and make you one of them, they\rquote ll know everything I told you.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj And that goes for everyone. My neighbors could be Controllers. My teachers could be Controllers. The police. The army. Even close family. So we keep this side of our lives secret.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj \ldblquote But Rachel,\rdblquote  I\rquote m sure you\rquote re thinking, \ldblquote I\rquote m pretty sure I\rquote d know if my mom or dad was suddenly being controlled by an alien.\rdblquote  Think again. With access to their minds, they can behave exactly like your mom and dad.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj They don\rquote t always do, of course. Just when you start feeling safe, think their hosts are normal, they\rquote ll start doing and suggesting things to work toward their goal. To control every single human being, so they don\rquote t have to fake anymore. Then they\rquote ll make Earth just like their home world. Destroy all that we humans worked to accomplish. Kill every living thing that they don\rquote t strictly need to keep us alive. And then move on to the next species unfortunate enough to be big enough to carry a Yeerk.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj Yeerks do have one weakness. At least every three days, they need to leave their host to swim around in what\rquote s known as a Yeerk pool, to soak up nutrients and Kandrona rays. If you can prevent a Controller from doing so, the Yeerk will starve, and the host will be free again.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj I\rquote ve seen it. Jake was infested once after a mission. If it weren\rquote t for Ax, we wouldn\rquote t even have realized before it was too late. But we did, and kept him locked up in this abandoned shack out in the forest for three days straight. It wasn\rquote t exactly a pretty sight when the Yeerk finally gave in, but it sure #was satisfying.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj Ax, by the way, is an Andalite. His full name is Aximili-Esgarrouth-Isthill. Giving you {\i his} full name doesn\rquote t really matter \endash  Yeerks will attack any Andalite on sight anyway. That is, if the Andalite gives them the chance.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj Andalites look a bit like blue deer, but have a pair of human-like arms in addition to their four #hooved legs, a very alien head, and a deadly scorpion\rquote s tail. They have an astonishing amount of control over that tail of theirs. It\rquote s so fast that humans can hardly see it move, yet you won\rquote t ever see one cut anything that its owner wasn\rquote t intending to cut. And their tail blade is very sharp. If you get on an Andalite\rquote s bad side, you won\rquote t even know what hit you. #Even if you\rquote re looking right at him.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj You\rquote ll also have a hard time sneaking up on one. Andalites have four eyes. Two of them face forward, not dissimilar from human eyes. The other two are on stalks above their head, like crab\rquote s eyes. They constantly shift around, independent of each other, scanning for possible threats.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj You won\rquote t hear an Andalite either if he doesn\rquote t want you to. They can run very quietly, and they don\rquote t have to talk to communicate with one another. They don\rquote t even have a mouth to do that with; they just have two slits where a human mouth would be. Instead, they communicate telepathically, and absorb nutrients through their hooves.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj Yeerks and Andalites hate each other indiscriminately. They\rquote re at war. So, in a way, that makes the Andalites the good guys of the galaxy. But they\rquote re not infallible. In fact, an Andalite called Seerow was the one who gave the Yeerks #spacefaring technology. Before the war, of course. He felt sorry for them. You\rquote ll have to ask Cassie to explain how anyone could pity those monsters. Pity for Yeerks is not my strong suit.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj The Andalites won\rquote t be making that mistake again any time soon though. They instated a law known as Seerow\rquote s Kindness, forbidding them from giving any of their technology to any other race. I guess the Andalites feel responsible for the Yeerks because of Seerow, so they\rquote re doing all they can to revert his actions.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj Unfortunately, they seem to be losing.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj They lost, for instance, when they sent one of their great dome ships to help Earth. And it\rquote ll be at least another year or so before they can spare another ship.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj They were vastly outnumbered and slaughtered at a battle we witnessed on the Leeran home world. Although they did manage to blow up most of the remaining Yeerks with our help, so I guess you could call that one a tie.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj But they definitely lost trying to protect the Hork-Bajir from the Yeerks. Now there are very few free Hork-Bajir around. In fact, there used to be none for a very long time, until an Ellimist intervened and used us to free two of them. Ellimists are\'85 hard to explain. They are virtually all-powerful, like gods, but they say they can\rquote t or won\rquote t intervene with mortal affairs. They do, though. At least one of them does. He wants to protect all forms of life from the Yeerks, but he\rquote s doing the absolute bare minimum to help. And he\rquote ll deny doing even that.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj The Yeerks use Hork-Bajir as soldiers. They were a good choice for the job: Hork-Bajir are almost as dangerous as Andalites. They have several horns and blades protruding from their heavily armored bodies, feet like a tyrannosaurus, and a beak that\rquote s close to a falcon\rquote s. In their natural form they\rquote re actually docile and not very smart, but that hardly matters now, because Yeerks {\i are} smart, and are anything {\i but} docile.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj So there we stood, frozen. Staring in disbelief at the sight of the Hork-Bajir, the shattered changing rooms, the poor woman who happened to be changing two stalls over, and the dark tunnel entrance that the Hork-Bajir exposed. There must have been a secret entrance to the Yeerk pool underneath the city there. We know there\rquote s at least one other entrance like that in the mall, but I wouldn\rquote t have been casually shopping at this store if I\rquote d known about this one.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj Everyone else froze, too. Most people froze because it\rquote s not every day you see something as scary and obviously alien as a Hork-Bajir. Other people froze because they know Hork-Bajir aren\rquote t supposed to show themselves in broad daylight, and there will be hell to pay for it later. Cassie and I froze mostly because we weren\rquote t sure initially if this Hork-Bajir was still a Controller, and if so, if he was out here because the Yeerks found out about us and stopped trying to be discrete.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj Even the Hork-Bajir froze. I don\rquote t know what he was expecting to happen after escaping from the pool through a mall entrance, but apparently it wasn\rquote t this.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj The woman in the changing room was the first to start screaming. Then everything just exploded. The Hork-Bajir blazed right past us toward the exit. Most people panicked and ran off into random directions, but some just kept staring, and some hesitantly started running after the Hork-Bajir. \par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj Suddenly it was pretty clear who was a Controller and who was just in the wrong place at the wrong time. It was also clear now that this was not in any way planned by the Yeerks. #Which means that the Hork-Bajir must have escaped while his Yeerk was swimming around in the pool.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj \ldblquote We have to help him,\rdblquote  I heard Cassie say.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj I wasn\rquote t so sure about that. I mean, I wanted to help him, too. But he wasn\rquote t our problem either. Truth is, I wasn\rquote t really sure {\i what} we could do to help him right then, anyway. Two teens who have to hide their identity from the Yeerks can hardly stand up to the hundreds of human- and dozens of Hork-Bajir-Controllers that\rquote ll soon be swarming around the mall.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj Not that we\rquote re entirely helpless. See, Ax isn\rquote t the only Andalite who survived the destruction of the dome ship. Ax\rquote s brother, Elfangor, was still alive when his ship crashed in the abandoned construction site near the mall. Cassie, Jake, Marco, Tobias, and I just so happened to be cutting through there right then.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj Elfangor was hurt in the crash, or maybe by the weapons fire that caused it. We tried to help, but there wasn\rquote t anything we could do. He was dying. Instead, he helped us. Well, not exactly us specifically; \lquote us\rquote  as in humankind. With what little time he had left, he told us all he could about the Yeerks. And then did something that no Andalite had done since Seerow. He gave us some of their technology.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj Specifically, he gave us an ability that almost all Andalites have: the power to morph. To change into any animal that you can manage to acquire through touch.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj In case you\rquote re wondering what good that does, well, try standing up to me when I turn into a grizzly bear or an African elephant, or try figuring out that I\rquote m spying on you from a mile away as a bald eagle. We even get the same telepathic thought-speak abilities that Andalites have while we\rquote re in morph. Also, because morphing is based on DNA, and DNA doesn\rquote t get damaged when you get hurt, morphing will heal you. That\rquote s pretty important in our line of work.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj There are a couple of limitations to morphing though.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj First and foremost, you can\rquote t stay in a morph for more than two hours at a time. If you do, you get stuck. That\rquote s what happened to Tobias. He got trapped in his red-tailed hawk morph on one of our first missions. He\rquote s since regained his power to morph, even back to his old body; a reward from the Ellimist for helping him to free those two Hork-Bajir that I\rquote d talked about. But his hawk body is now his natural form. So that means that he can only stay human for two hours, or he won\rquote t be able to morph ever again. And he wants to help us fight the Yeerks, which he can\rquote t do if he can\rquote t morph.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj Secondly, you can only morph skin-tight clothing. Shoes and loose clothes don\rquote t work. Since we can\rquote t exactly go walking around in public wearing spandex superhero suits, we always end up having to hide our clothing somewhere when we have to morph. Usually we can retrieve it later, but not #always.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj Third, you can\rquote t go from one morph directly to another. You have to go through your natural form. Very inconvenient when you have to hide your true identity. Morphing also isn\rquote t instant. It takes at least a minute to do. And while you\rquote re doing it, you\rquote re very, very vulnerable. That\rquote s why we couldn\rquote t just morph to something big and dangerous right there and then.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj All Elfangor had to do to give us our morphing abilities was to have us touch a small blue box known as an Escafil device. We\rquote d figured it got destroyed in the explosions that followed soon after, but we recently recovered it. Well, David did. But I don\rquote t really want to talk about David. He brought out the worst in me. Well, in all of us. We ended up having to maroon him on a small, deserted island a mile or so off the coast, far enough away from civilization that no one would hear his thought-speak screams. We\rquote d first gotten him stuck in a rat morph, so there\rquote s no way for him to get out of there alive.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj The alternative would have been to just end him. Because he was trying very hard to sell us out to the Yeerks or just kill us himself. And he got way too close.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj Anyway, just after Elfangor gave us our morphing abilities, the Yeerks showed up. They don\rquote t like leaving evidence behind.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj It\rquote s not a happy memory. I still get nightmares from it, even after all the other stuff that I went through since, and I probably will for a very long time yet.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj We had to hide and watch helplessly as Visser Three morphed into some huge alien and ate Elfangor alive.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj #Visser Three, the only Yeerk in existence to have ever succeeded in taking an Andalite, morph-capable host.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj #Visser Three, the current leader of the Earth invasion.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj #Visser Three, who has tried to kill me and my friends more often than I care to remember.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj \ldblquote Don\rquote t just stand there, you idiots,\rdblquote  I heard a human voice behind us call. \ldblquote Visser Three will have us all for lunch if we don\rquote t get that Hork-Bajir and get this whole place on #lockdown before half the city\rquote s seen him!\rdblquote  \par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj A Controller. He sounded desperate, and he was right to. Visser Three, who frequently kills his subordinates, Yeerk and host alike, just to make a point. We\rquote ve seen him do it for much less important screw-ups than letting a Hork-Bajir escape and free-roam around the mall.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj We still just stood there. #We watched as the Hork-Bajir ran out of the store \endash  not through the door, through a display window \endash  into the Saturday afternoon crowd of the mall plaza. The store\rquote s clerks rushed out after him, while its customers scattered out in various directions. The clerks must have all been Controllers, the store being a Yeerk pool entrance and all.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj As if all of that didn\rquote t cause enough of a ruckus, the window shattering also set off the burglary alarm of the store.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj Suddenly, a hand on my shoulder! It jerked me around!\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj \ldblquote Are you deaf?\rdblquote \par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj Time seemed to slow to a crawl. It was the Controller who I\rquote d heard yell. He was yelling at us, apparently. Behind him stood a whole contingent of armed Controllers. A mix of humans and Hork-Bajir. They must have followed the Hork-Bajir out through the Yeerk pool entrance, which we\rquote d turned our backs to in order to watch the escaping Hork-Bajir. Stupid!\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj They were all carrying Dracon beams. A handheld Dracon beam is about the size of a pistol, but looks more #sci-fi than that and shoots lasers that completely evaporate what they hit. Or stun, they can do that too. But they don\rquote t use that setting very often.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj My mind was racing, trying to decide between fight or flight. But neither would really accomplish anything. They\rquote d kill or infest us either way. Unable to make a decision, I was completely frozen again. And I hated myself for it. Doing something, {\i anything}, would have been better than doing nothing!\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj #So that was it. We were done for. They\rquote d realize we weren\rquote t Controllers in no time. Yet we\rquote d clearly seen a Hork-Bajir before. I mean, all normal people had run off by now. We were the only two idiots just standing there gawking at it. And free humans aren\rquote t supposed to see anything Yeerk-related.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj He must have been able to read the shock and defeat from my face. If he couldn\rquote t, I\rquote m sure Cassie\rquote s face would have sufficed.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj They\rquote d force us down into the Yeerk pool and infest us. I\rquote ve been down there before, except that was on missions. Even when our plans backfired completely, and they almost always did, we still had some degree of control. But this would be different.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj I\rquote ve seen them do it. They would have two Hork-Bajir for each of us, dragging us down to the infestation pier over the pool. Once there, they would kick us in the back of our legs to force us to kneel down. Then they would push our heads down into the pool. Finally, we\rquote d feel the Yeerk slither into our ears.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj And once we\rquote d be made Controllers, they\rquote d know who we are. They\rquote d come for Jake, Marco, Tobias, and Ax. Our families too, I\rquote m sure, just to spite us. Maybe they\rquote d make us kill them ourselves. Or maybe they\rquote d just make them hosts to the lowliest of Yeerks, make them clean up their dirty work or something. Or just torture them outright, and make us watch them break. Whatever they\rquote d do, I\rquote m sure it wouldn\rquote t be nice.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj You have no idea just how much Visser Three hates us. And he\rquote s not a forgiving kind of being.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj But then the man just shoved a Dracon beam in my hands and ran off after the Hork-Bajir, along with the other human and Hork-Bajir Controllers from the Yeerk pool.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj He just gave me a weapon that no free human is ever supposed to get their hands on. Just like that.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj \ldblquote #Wh\'85 #Wha?\rdblquote  I managed to say when he was gone.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj \ldblquote #Uhh,\rdblquote  Cassie affirmed, staring at the Dracon beam. Her face was as pale as it could get.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj \ldblquote H-how about we just get out of here?\rdblquote  she stammered, and gingerly hung the dress back on a nearby clothing rack. She was visibly trembling from the fear and adrenaline rush.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj So was I, actually.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj \ldblquote Y-yeah, good idea.\rdblquote \par }
{\pard \plain \s1 \outlinelevel0 \fs36 \b Chapter 2\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj The situation outside the store can only be described as complete chaos. We couldn\rquote t see much of what was going on at first, with all the fleeing people in the way. We only got a glimpse of the situation when we came to the stairs down to the first floor.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj A number of Hork-Bajir-Controllers were already surrounding the poor escapee. There was no way he was going to get out of this alive without a Yeerk in his head. Even with the Dracon beam, there wasn\rquote t anything we could do for him. I considered mercy-killing him with it, but there was no way I\rquote d be able to hit him from this distance. Not without risking hitting some innocent bystander, anyway. I saw Cassie was looking at him helplessly.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj \ldblquote There\rquote s nothing we can do for him, Cassie.\rdblquote \par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj \ldblquote I know.\rdblquote \par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj Her voice was breaking up. Cassie\rquote s a lot more sensitive than I am; this sort of thing hurts her deeply. It\rquote s not that I didn\rquote t care about the Hork-Bajir at all or something, but we\rquote d have time to mourn him later.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj Meanwhile, the mall exits were already being blocked by human Controllers. No one was getting in or out. I couldn\rquote t help but be just a little impressed at how quickly they got the situation under control. They must have been preparing for events like these.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj The blocked exits completed the panic among all the free humans. People were literally running head-on into one another, not knowing where to go.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj \ldblquote We\rquote re never going to get out of here without being seen,\rdblquote  Cassie added.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj \ldblquote So we find a place to morph something big and go out fighting,\rdblquote  I said, sounding more self-determined than I felt. I hadn\rquote t exactly thought it through yet, but my anger and hatred toward the Yeerks was starting to win over my other emotions.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj Like I said before, I don\rquote t like showing my fear. I usually just get angry, instead. It\rquote s because of times like these that my friends think I\rquote m Xena.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj \ldblquote I\rquote ve a better idea,\rdblquote  Cassie said. \ldblquote Come on.\rdblquote \par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj She pulled me along into the crowd, heading straight for the main exit. As we passed the group of Hork-Bajir, we saw the escapee lie on the floor in a puddle of his own blood. He was probably still alive though, because they were going through the effort of cuffing him. \par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj \ldblquote Does your plan involve kicking Yeerk butt? Because that\rquote s what I feel like doing right now.\rdblquote \par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj \ldblquote So do I, but we can\rquote t fight here and win.\rdblquote \par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj I just groaned at that. She was right, of course.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj \ldblquote Just play along. We\rquote re Controllers now.\rdblquote \par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj Wait, what? We\rquote re Controllers now? Was she just giving up? No, that wasn\rquote t right. But then what\'85\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj There was no more time to think. Cassie was already forcing her way through the crowd to the Controllers at the main entrance, and she was pulling me along.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj \ldblquote Let us through,\rdblquote  Cassie yelled at the first Controller she reached.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj Oh, great plan, Cassie. Literally everyone around you had the same idea. The Controller ignored her, of course.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj \ldblquote Listen, you idiot, we saw someone push his way through you guys just a minute ago.\rdblquote \par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj She grabbed the Dracon beam from me and held it up in front of the Controller\rquote s face. Not threateningly, she was kind of just showing him we had it.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj \ldblquote Or would you like me to pass your incompetence on to Visser Three?\rdblquote \par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj Okay, no sarcasm now: that was actually smart. Dangerous, sure, but so was my idea. Cassie can lie pretty convincingly when she has to, as long as it doesn\rquote t involve hiding her emotions. And the Controllers were all just as scared as we were. Scared of Visser Three.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj He let us through.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj The situation outside wasn\rquote t much less chaotic, but it was a #whole lot safer. Some people were running away, probably having heard the screaming or having seen a glimpse of the Hork-Bajir from outside. Other people were casually heading toward the sealed entrance of the mall, wondering what those people were running from. A police car was just arriving at the scene, and I could hear more sirens further away. Maybe they were Controllers, but more likely they were just responding to the store alarm, or maybe people have just been calling 911. Who knows?\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj We ran for the first empty alley that seemed far enough away for us to safely catch our breath. Along the way, I opened my mouth a couple times to start explaining my plan for dealing with the situation, but no plan came. At least, no plan that was better than going in with elephant and rhino morphs to cause enough extra chaos to let people escape. And that was a suicide mission. There were so many armed Controllers in the mall now, that it was basically an extension of the Yeerk pool.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj We kind of just collapsed in that alley, as the adrenaline rush was starting to wear off. We were silent for a while. Cassie was the first to speak.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj \ldblquote I wonder how the Yeerks are going to cover this up. They can\rquote t infest everyone, can they?\rdblquote \par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj She was trembling at the thought.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj \ldblquote I\rquote m sure they\rquote ll think of a way,\rdblquote  I growled. \ldblquote We have to do something.\rdblquote \par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj We were both silent for a while again. I guess Cassie had also run out of good ideas.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj \ldblquote I can\rquote t believe that Controller just gave you his Dracon beam,\rdblquote  she finally said.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj I nodded. \ldblquote We make for convincing Controllers, apparently.\rdblquote \par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj \ldblquote Do you think they\rquote ll be able to track it?\rdblquote \par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj I hadn\rquote t thought of that. We know that the Yeerks can detect the presence of materials that don\rquote t belong on Earth. We once found the Yeerks spending a #whole lot of effort trying to secure what turned out to be an ancient Andalite toilet that crashed on Earth decades ago. They couldn\rquote t work out from orbit what it was, but they weren\rquote t taking any chances.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj I groaned. \ldblquote As much as I hate to do it, maybe we should just hide it here for now. Then we\rquote ll ask Ax if it\rquote s safe to keep it and come back for it later.\rdblquote \par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj Cassie hid the Dracon beam underneath a nearby dumpster.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj \ldblquote We should also find a place to put our clothes,\rdblquote  she said. \ldblquote We need a meeting, like right now. Maybe someone else has a good idea.\rdblquote \par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj I knew what she meant. Morph into birds, then round up the others. I was already starting to undress down to my morphing suit by the time she\rquote d finished her sentence. We always wear something skintight underneath our clothes nowadays, like my black leotard. Just in case.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj \ldblquote Where do we meet? Do we go straight back to the mall?\rdblquote \par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj \ldblquote Guess there\rquote s no harm in that if we\rquote re birds\'85 Should probably do seagulls though, so we don\rquote t draw too much attention to ourselves.\rdblquote \par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj The Yeerks know we\rquote re out here and that we can morph. Despite that, most Yeerks aren\rquote t that vigilant at looking out for oddly behaving animals, but Visser Three always is. And with something like this going on, he\rquote s sure to show up sooner or later.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj Fortunately though, the Yeerks think we\rquote re Andalites. If they ever work out that we\rquote re mostly just a couple of human teenagers who call themselves the Animorphs, this\rquote ll all be over quickly. That\rquote s why it\rquote s important that they can\rquote t find our shoes and clothes along with the Dracon beam, should they be able to track it.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj I found a dirty discarded shopping bag in a corner of the alley. \ldblquote Better than nothing,\rdblquote  I grumbled to myself, and put my shoes, clothes, and handbag inside. Then I picked up Cassie\rquote s shoes and clothes, which she\rquote d just thrown on the ground. She was already morphing. Then I grumpily shoved the bag behind some garbage on the other side of the alley, and started to morph as well.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj Cassie has a talent for morphing. She has some control over the order in which her body parts change. Maybe it\rquote s because she spends so much time with animals.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj Cassie\rquote s parents are both vets. Her mom works as a caretaker at The Gardens, a mix of a theme park and a zoo. Cassie and her dad together run the Wildlife Rehabilitation Clinic from their barn. They take in local injured wildlife and try to nurse the animals back to health. As you might expect, The Gardens and Cassie\rquote s clinic are where we\rquote d acquired most of our morphs.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj Cassie had started with her wings. She always does that when she morphs a bird. It makes her look almost like an angel. She\rquote d do the rest of the bird\rquote s features one by one, and leave the shrinking for last.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj Not me.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj The first thing that happened to me was a beak shooting out of my lips. The second thing was my eyes moving to the sides of my head. Cassie looked away. As usual, it was not a pretty sight, even when you\rquote re used to seeing it. It doesn\rquote t hurt though. Which is good, because if it would, it\rquote d hurt like hell.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj I saw the flesh on my legs and feet shrivel away to make place for talons with my left eye, while seeing the sky above the alley with my right. I guess my head was cocked sideways. Maybe the left side of my neck was shrinking faster than the right side?\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj Seeing in two different directions at the same time hurt my brain. Until the seagull\rquote s brain joins mine, I won\rquote t be able to make much sense of it. The picture was already crispy clear, though. Birds have much better eyesight than humans do.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj And then I saw the ground come toward me. I would have jerked if I wouldn\rquote t have done this so often already. Shrinking feels like falling, yet never quite hitting the ground. Like those nightmares where you\rquote re running toward something but never quite reach it completely. But you get used to it.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj I was almost #done morphing when the seagull\rquote s mind kicked in. You always get the instincts of the animal you morph into as part of the morph. That\rquote s usually a good thing, for instance because humans aren\rquote t that great at flying. Sometimes you even get some memories from the animal somehow.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj But those instincts can be overwhelming. Especially the first time you morph an animal. One time, I jumped into an alligator pit at The Gardens to save a boy who fell in accidentally. I\rquote d acquired the first alligator I could find and morphed into it immediately, just barely hidden from the crowd, hugging the walls of the enclosure. My plan was to stave off the other alligators, of course, until the trainers would arrive. But in the end, the only reason I didn\rquote t chomp up that little boy myself right there and then was because fighting for dominance with the other alligators was higher up my list of priorities.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj With most new morphs, it only takes a couple minutes for our human mind to take back control. It depends very much on the animal though. We never quite got over the seagull\rquote s instincts. But they\rquote re not exactly dangerous, so I guess it\rquote s more that we\rquote re usually just not really trying to contain them.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj I shot up into the air as soon as I finished morphing. Out of the alley. I could find much better food elsewhere.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj Cassie must have had the same idea. She was already circling overhead by the time I was done.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj <There\rquote s a guy eating fries only a block away!> she thought-spoke to me.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj Fries? No {\i way} I was going to let her have them all to herself!\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj No, snap out of it. There are lives at stake here.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj <I\rquote ll go get Jake and Marco, you get Tobias and Ax. Okay?>\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj <No way, you just want the fries to yourself.>\par }
{\pard \plain \s1 \outlinelevel0 \fs36 \b Chapter 3\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj <I swear; only Rachel can go to the mall and leave with a Dracon beam. From a 100%-off clearance sale, no less!>\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj That was Marco. His preferred mode of communication is sarcasm. Especially when we\rquote re all nervous. Jake and I ignored him.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj <Okay, that\rquote s not one of my best. But you have to admit it was a {\i little} funny.>\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj The three of us had just arrived at the mall. Jake and Marco both live relatively close by compared to Tobias and Ax, and Cassie would also have to find them first, so she\rquote d take a while longer than I had.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj All three of us were in our seagull morphs. We perched down on a ledge of a building opposite to the mall entrance.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj All in all, I was only gone for maybe twenty minutes. Apparently that was enough time for the police to completely surround and secure the mall. They put down screens in front of the mall entrance windows to prevent people from looking inside, and taped off the surrounding area. They clearly weren\rquote t just responding to 911 calls. #They came prepared. This was the work of Controllers high up in the police chain of command.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj The police screens weren\rquote t high enough to block {\i our} view, though. I could see that almost everyone was down on the floor inside. Now, bird\rquote s eyes are almost infinitely better than human eyes, so even at this distance, and through the dirty and reflecting windows, I could see that they were still breathing. Unconscious, but alive. Stunned by Dracon beams, I guessed.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj <The Yeerks seem to want everyone alive,> I said.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj <Of course they do,> Marco said. <They can hardly go around killing everyone who was in there that wasn\rquote t a Controller, can they? It would be headline news all over the world. They don\rquote t want that kind of attention near a Yeerk pool entrance.>\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj As much as Marco always gets on my nerves, he\rquote s the best of us at figuring out these sorts of things.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj <But if they\rquote ve stunned everyone with Dracon beams, everyone will realize something weird is going on when they wake up\'85> I wondered out loud.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj I realized what was happening, of course. I\rquote m not that stupid. But I was really hoping that Marco would have figured out a good reason for them to not do what I was thinking they were going to do.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj <They\rquote ll need to make everyone a Controller before they leave, yeah.>\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj So much for that.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj <We can\rquote t let that happen,> Jake said. <There\rquote s easily, what, five hundred people in there? But we should wait for the others first. Let\rquote s play seagull around here for a while, and see what we can see.>\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj There was no discussion, we just obeyed. Jake is sort of the leader of the group. Not that he wants to be, it\rquote s just a natural thing. And that\rquote s precisely why he\rquote s good at it. He knows that his decisions can mean life or death, so he thinks them through as much as he can, and he\rquote ll carefully weigh in our thoughts and opinions when we share them. But he\rquote ll also make a snap decision when he has to. We won\rquote t always agree, we won\rquote t always understand at the time, but you need someone like that in a group. Even Ax decided that Jake is his leader now, or \lquote prince,\rquote  as Andalites call it.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj I let the seagull in me swoop down to the empty ground between the entrance and the police-do-not-cross tape. It saw some discarded cookie crumbs and figured it was better than nothing. Or well, I was forcing it to hang around the mall entrance, otherwise it\rquote d have flown right to the beach. There\rquote s way better food there.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj While the seagull in me was picking at cookie crumbs, I listened in on the conversations between the crowd and the police.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj \ldblquote What\rquote s going on?\rdblquote  I heard some #woman ask a policeman.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj \ldblquote There was an armed robbery at the jewelry store, ma\rquote am. You\rquote ll have to come back later.\rdblquote \par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj \ldblquote Oh my, was anyone hurt?\rdblquote \par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj \ldblquote We can neither confirm nor deny that.\rdblquote \par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj #So that was their excuse to the outside world. It\rquote d explain the blood stains and the damage well enough, I guess; the jewelry store was just one store over from where Cassie and I\rquote d been shopping. And they could even pass off the Hork-Bajir as people in full-body suits to anyone who got a glimpse of them but got away. People are like that. They\rquote ll easily accept lies like that if they make more sense than their own memories. Anyone stubborn enough to not believe the lie wouldn\rquote t be believed by anyone else.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj <Oh man. Hork-Bajir are carrying people off to the Yeerk pool two at a time,> I heard Marco in my head.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj That\rquote s bad. It wouldn\rquote t take them long to get everyone inside that way, out of our reach.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj The Yeerks recently upped their security at the pool. They now have devices at all the entrances that detect and destroy any life forms not registered in their system, and robots flying around inside doing the same thing. The last time we went in, we had to spend several days digging a tunnel down as moles to bypass the entrances. Our tunnel intersected with a cave filled with bats, so we\rquote d acquired some of those to fly inside. But once there, the robots took us down pretty fast. They\rquote d shot a hole through one of my wings, and burned the other clear off. I fell right into the Yeerk pool.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj Fortunately, bats are too small to be infested. But I had to morph back to human while still inside the pool, underneath the infestation pier, because my bat body could hardly move anymore.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj <And our good friend Visser Three is already here,> Jake said bitterly.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj It just keeps getting better and better.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj <We can\rquote t wait for the others,> I said. <We have to get in there {\i now}, or everyone will be a Controller by the time they arrive.>\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj <Do you have a plan, oh mighty Xena?> Marco asked me.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj And suddenly one came to me. The beginning of one, anyway.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj <We need to cut them off from the Yeerk pool. Blow up the tunnel with the Dracon beam.>\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj <Oh man.>\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj It was not a happy memory for any of us. We\rquote d escaped from the Yeerk pool that last time by blowing up one of the tunnels. With us still in it. Shooting the roof with a Dracon beam did the trick.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj Cassie and Marco were still in battle morph, even. They had to morph to human first to be able to morph back to mole and dig their way out. And we all had to remorph the mole underground once before we found our way back to the bat cave, in order to not be a mole forever. It had been the only way out.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj <To do that, we have to get inside the tunnel first,> Jake noted. <What about that Gleet BioFilter thing?>\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj That\rquote s the name of the device that protects the entrance from unwanted DNA.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj <If it works based on DNA, won\rquote t they have it disabled now? #Otherwise it\rquote d fry anyone they\rquote d carry in there.>\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj <It could also be based on species rather than individual DNA,> Marco pointed out. <It could still fry us if we go in as some animal.>\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj <Well, I have a Hork-Bajir morph\'85>\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj My morph was one of the two Hork-Bajir who the Ellimist helped us free. Or we helped the Ellimist free. Whatever. We\rquote d morphed them to help stage their suicide, so the Yeerks would stop hunting them.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj But we don\rquote t like morphing anything sentient. At that point, what really separates us from the Yeerks? The Hork-Bajir had consented to us morphing them to help them then, but I don\rquote t exactly have time to find her and ask if she\rquote d be okay with me using her body now. Still, I was pretty sure she {\i would} be okay with anything that helps fight the Yeerks. Especially if it\rquote s in part to avenge a recaptured Hork-Bajir.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj We were silent for a minute, thinking it through.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj <You\rquote ll need a distraction too, otherwise you\rquote re never getting out of there alive,> Jake said. <Unless you want to try the mole thing again.>\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj It was a rhetorical question. No, {\i that} I did {\i not} want to do again. {\i #Ever.}\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj <So here\rquote s what we could do. First, we find a place where we can get Rachel into the mall safely and unseen, with the Dracon beam. She then morphs Hork-Bajir and hangs out by the tunnel entrance like she belongs. Meanwhile, Marco and I morph rhino in some alley and barge in through the main entrance. We have a nice little chat with Visser Three, and tell him to leave these people alone and cover it up with some chemical spill that causes mass hallucinations or something. #Otherwise we blow up his tunnel and make him do it anyway.>\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj <Yeah, sure,> Marco said. <Visser Three will totally eat that up. He\rquote ll say, \ldblquote Oh, sweet Andalite bandits, I would have never come up with something as smart as that myself! What would I ever do without you? That\rquote s so much better than just making everyone here a Controller, like I was going to do eventually anyway!\rdblquote >\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj <Marco, do you have a better idea?> I asked. He was starting to get on my nerves.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj <Yes. We could just walk away and let them have this one.>\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj <Seriously?> I raged. <What if your dad were in there?>\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj That shut him up. It was a low blow. His mom is a Controller. A very important one at that, Visser One. We weren\rquote t even sure if she was still alive then. She might not have survived one of our previous missions.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj <Rachel, that\rquote s not helping,> Jake said, trying to calm the situation. Calming Marco and me down is normally Cassie\rquote s job.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj <I hate the Yeerks as much as you do, Rachel,> he growled, clearly holding back. <But we can\rquote t go in here on a suicide mission. Not unless it deals with the Yeerks permanently.>\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj <Well, I still say we do it,> I said defiantly.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj <You {\i always} say that.>\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj <Jake?>\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj <Ugh, you know I hate it when you guys make me take decisions like that, right? But these are a lot of new Controllers. Including all the mall staff, at least from this shift. They\rquote d have #free reign over this place. Heck, they wouldn\rquote t even need any other Yeerk pool entrances anymore. So I have to side with Rachel, unless we can think of a better plan. Let\rquote s go look for a way in for Rachel first. Then we can decide whether we go for it or not.>\par }
{\pard \plain \s1 \outlinelevel0 \fs36 \b Chapter 4\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj We found an open window leading to the kitchen of one of the restaurants at the food court. It was opened far enough for me to crawl through using my rat morph, and it was on the first floor, so we could easily drop the Dracon beam inside first.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj Since none of us had come up with any better idea, we decided to go for it. I flew back to the alley where Cassie and I had left our things, demorphed, and put my clothes back on. I\rquote d have to just walk back to the alley with the kitchen window, because the Dracon beam would be too heavy and too obvious to carry as a seagull. So I put the Dracon beam in the shopping bag along with Cassie\rquote s clothes, and started walking back.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj Man, I looked like a homeless person. My clothes were stained from the inside of the shopping bag, and the bag itself wasn\rquote t helping. But I didn\rquote t stand out too much. No one paid any attention to me as I went from alley to alley.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj I hesitated when I got back to the kitchen window. Marco {\i was} right; this could easily turn into a suicide mission for all of us. Then again, that goes for pretty much every mission we go on.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj No time to think about it. There\rquote ll be plenty of time to do that during the nightmares that are sure to follow. So I morphed to rat.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj <Can you guys hear me? Are you ready?> I asked my friends before I went inside.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj <We hear you, and we\rquote re ready,> Marco responded. He didn\rquote t exactly sound happy about it, but when we decide to go for a mission, we all have to do our part, even when we don\rquote t agree with it. Marco understood that.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj I could feel that his thoughts were distant, but they were still clear. We never quite figured out the exact range of thought-speak, but it isn\rquote t infinite.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj <Okay, I\rquote m in my rat morph, heading for the window now.>\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj I morphed back out as soon as I got inside, not giving my rat instincts time to take over with all the tasty smells of an abandoned kitchen. Then I immediately morphed Hork-Bajir.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj Morphing in rapid succession like that is tiring like you won\rquote t believe, but sometimes it has to be done. I wasn\rquote t going as fast as I could though. I knew free lives were at stake, but I didn\rquote t want to tire myself too much before the action even started.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj Fortunately, Hork-Bajir have great endurance. I didn\rquote t feel as tired anymore when the Hork-Bajir brain joined mine. But that was about the only thing I felt. The smarter the being, the less powerful its instincts seem to be. And fortunately we don\rquote t get the conscious part of a morph\rquote s brain.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj I picked up the Dracon beam, then found my way through the kitchen to the food court. From there, I could see the plaza, where the Hork-Bajir had lined up their unconscious victims, and from where Visser Three was observing. He was in his natural Andalite form. It\rquote s hard to tell emotions from an Andalite face, especially at such a distance, but it was a safe bet that he was not happy about the situation.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj <Hurry up,> I heard him yell at one of the Hork-Bajir as she was trying to pick up one of the\'85 wider people. <The longer this place stays locked down, the more attention we draw to ourselves!>\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj Thought-speak can be directed to only those people who you want to hear it. Or you can just shout to anyone in range. Visser Three almost always did the latter. Someone as powerful as him doesn\rquote t need to hide.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj He could see me, so I had to fit in. I gingerly walked over to the closest unconscious human I could find. There were so few people left! At least half of the people who were in here had already been taken down. We\rquote d wasted way too much time already!\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj The person I found was a young girl. She was about my youngest sister Sarah\rquote s age. Her cheeks were still red and wet from crying before she was Draconed. I accidentally cut her arm shallowly with my elbow blade as I picked her up.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj <I\rquote m so sorry about this,> I thought-spoke to her alone. She wouldn\rquote t have heard me, of course, unconscious and all. But I felt like I had to say something. If I\rquote d have had to use my human voice to say it, I\rquote d have choked up for sure.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj I started heading for the tunnel entrance. Fortunately, Visser Three didn\rquote t notice that I was carrying only one small person, and the other Hork-Bajir didn\rquote t care enough to draw Visser Three\rquote s attention to them. There was no way I was going to pick up any more people.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj <I\rquote m heading toward the tunnel entrance now!> I called to my friends. I suddenly realized that if their distraction wouldn\rquote t work, I was going to have to take her down to the pool and let the Yeerks infest her.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj Well, that was never going to happen. I\rquote d die first, and if that wasn\rquote t an option, I\rquote d sooner mercy-kill the girl than let them do that to her.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj Would I, though? Would I kill some 9-year old girl? Someone\rquote s daughter? Perhaps someone\rquote s sister? At least with a Yeerk inside her head, there\rquote d still be hope for her. Suddenly my own thoughts sickened me.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj Stop thinking about it, Rachel. You have a job to do, and if you do it right, you might still save this girl. Pay attention to what you\rquote re doing.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj As I refocused on the task at hand, I realized something was wrong. There were no Hork-Bajir walking {\i from} the Yeerk pool back to the plaza. So where were they coming from?\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj Of course! The other entrance! #There\rquote s {\i two} tunnels leading from the mall to the Yeerk pool, and they were using both to avoid having to deal with oncoming traffic. I\rquote d have to knock out both of them to cut the mall off from the pool!\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj But it was too late to change the plan. I heard a loud crash coming from the entrance as Jake and Marco\rquote s rhinos #ploughed right through it. I heard gunfire from outside, too. But normal police handguns don\rquote t do much against the thick skin of a rhino.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj <Andalites!> Visser Three yelled with utmost disgust, and everyone stopped.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj <All Hork-Bajir report to the mall immediately!> he added. #The Hork-Bajir around me instantly dropped their victims and ran back. You don\rquote t question Visser Three\rquote s orders unless you\rquote re suicidal.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj I guess I was a bit suicidal, going on this mission and all.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj <Visser Three, I have a deal for you,> I heard either Jake or Marco say. It was probably Jake, but I couldn\rquote t quite tell. <How about you just let these people go about their lives and cover this whole thing up with mass hallucinations, and \endash >\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj <How about I just kill you right here and now!> Visser Three fumed. But I didn\rquote t hear any Dracon beams. He hadn\rquote t given the order to fire yet.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj Don\rquote t get distracted by the distraction, Rachel! Do what you came here to do! Get into position to at least destroy one of the tunnels!\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj I was almost at the tunnel entrance that the Hork-Bajir had escaped through. I carefully laid the girl down on the floor.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj <Because there\rquote s only two of us here,> I heard Jake or Marco respond. <The other four are in position at the Yeerk pool entrance, ready to blow it to pieces.>\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj \lquote The\rquote  entrance. I hadn\rquote t told my friends that the entrance which the Hork-Bajir had escaped from wasn\rquote t the one we knew about!\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj I bolted for the nearest tunnel entrance. Nuts to the biofilter. We\rquote d decided that it was probably best for me to not go through the entrance, just in case the filter didn\rquote t work the way we thought it did. None of us ever really understand much of Ax\rquote s technobabble, and he hadn\rquote t been around to tell us whether it\rquote d kill me or not in this particular case. But I had to go through. I wasn\rquote t going to get the chance to blow up two tunnels if Jake\rquote s attempt at diplomacy didn\rquote t work out. But I figured that the two tunnels might join into one before they reach the Yeerk pool, so maybe I could blow up the common part.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj I could\rquote ve yelled at Jake and Marco that there are two entrances. But it wouldn\rquote t have done them any good now. It\rquote d distract them from Visser Three, and maybe I could still fix this.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj I didn\rquote t know whether Visser Three was silent because he was carefully considering his options, not wanting to mess this up and lose us again, or because he was directing his thought-speak now, but I didn\rquote t hear him respond.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj Doesn\rquote t matter. Find the fork in the tunnels. I was already through the biofilter (if there even was one there) when I snapped back out of my thoughts and looked around me again. #Still alive. That\rquote s good.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj <Rachel, blow up the tunnel!> I heard in my head suddenly.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj No! I\rquote m not in position yet! #Unless\'85 Unless I blow up the tunnel behind me and double back through the other. #If I could find it at all. I could get trapped in the Yeerk pool.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj But I had to do it. Jake and Marco could be counting on the distraction caused by the explosion. So I took a shot and fired.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj It just made a clean hole in the roof of the tunnel. I could see daylight shine through it.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj No!\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj I shot again. That time it worked.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj I hauled. I almost got covered by rubble as a large section of the tunnel collapsed. Still, a few dozen yards after the collapse, I figured, \ldblquote what the hell,\rdblquote  and took another shot behind me. More of the roof came hurtling down. Enough to kill the lights in the remaining part of the tunnel, so all I could see now was some faint light at the end of it. If there was a split ahead, I might not even see it.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj I ran for the light. It was coming from the huge cavern that houses the Yeerk pool. When I emerged, I was greeted by a large amount of startled alien eyes, wondering what had caused all the noise in the tunnel. I guess Visser Three\rquote s and Jake\rquote s thought-speak didn\rquote t reach all the way here, otherwise they\rquote d have realized.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj I quickly looked around to get my bearings. Only a few yards to the left of me was another tunnel opening. Both tunnels shared the same staircase down to the pool area. There was a sparse line of Hork-Bajir walking up the stairs. The other tunnel to the mall, it must be!\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj \ldblquote Visser Three orders retreat!\rdblquote  I yelled with all my power. Hork-Bajir can speak. Their own language isn\rquote t quite as advanced as English, so most of the time you\rquote ll hear Hork-Bajir speak a mixture of English and their own. Now, I didn\rquote t know any Hork-Bajir words, so I just used as few English words as I could. \ldblquote Andalite bandits!\rdblquote  I added. That\rquote s what the Yeerks call us.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj It was the kind of rash thing that I always end up doing in cases like these. The words left my mouth the millisecond I came up with them. I just wanted them out of that #tunnel so I could do what I had to do without getting cornered, but there were a million ways in which that could have backfired. If they\rquote d have called my bluff, I\rquote d have been done for.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj But they didn\rquote t. They believed me just long enough. Visser Three\rquote s arrogance and the fear he spreads among his underlings is going to be his downfall. No one dares to question his orders, even if they\rquote re passed on by someone else, and even if they don\rquote t make that much sense.\par }
{\pard \plain \s0 \qj I stood there watching for a moment as
