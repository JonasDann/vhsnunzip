                                    THE HUNT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                   CHAPTER 1
                                   ---------

My name is Rachel. That’s all, just Rachel.

I have a last name, of course. But I’m not going to tell you. I’m also not going
to tell you where I live. See, I have some very powerful enemies. Telling you
who I am would make it way too easy for them to find my friends.

Not that it would be all that difficult to find out who I am after I’ve told you
my story, if you’re one of my enemies or turn into one later. But I’m at least
not going to make it obvious.

I’m sure I sound like I’m either paranoid or involved with the mafia or
something. It’s not the latter. Maybe a little bit of the former. But I’d say
that's healthy for someone in my position.

My friends all say I’m fearless. Marco keeps calling me “Xena: Warrior
Princess”. I’m still not entirely sure whether he’s trying to flatter or mock
me, but I guess it’s not that far off. Except I’m younger, blond, I try to dress
sanely, and I’m not quite fearless. Especially not now that my family is
involved.

I just don’t like showing my fear.

But right then, I really wasn’t scared. I was right in my natural habitat: the
mall.

“I’m not sure about this,” Cassie said, holding what must be the millionth dress
I picked out for her in front of her.

Cassie’s my best friend. You wouldn’t think so, though. Cassie hates shopping,
and she normally really does not care about how she looks. You’ll almost always
find her in a torn-up pair of jeans about two sizes too small, an old stained
shirt, and boots. Not stylish boots, mind you, but the kind that you wear when
you know you’re going to be walking around in a combination of mud, hay, and
animal poo. Which is normally where you’ll find Cassie. That's her natural
habitat.

But recently she’s started to care a bit more. She and my cousin Jake have a
thing. Neither of them will admit to anything, but it’s painfully obvious.

She tried to be casual about it when she asked me to help her buy some new
clothes. Her excuse was that she just needs new clothes because, well, we go
through clothes a bit quicker than your average teenager. But when we got to the
mall, she kept eyeing the more fancy sections. And all the while she was
blushing.

I’d made it sound like it was my idea. “Maybe you should get something nicer
this time. How about a dress?” I’d said. She’d have denied everything and gotten
something plain otherwise. And what can I say, they’re cute together.

“It just doesn’t seem very practical,” Cassie added.

“This particular dress or a dress in general?” I asked, getting just a little
bit desperate.

But Cassie just stared off into the distance. If we were just your normal
everyday teens, you’d think she was just worried Jake wouldn’t like it. But
we’re not everyday teens. More likely, she was worrying about having to run for
her life while wearing it, or something of the sort. After all, those powerful
enemies of mine are hers as well.

“Why don’t you try it on? I’m sure it’ll look good on you,” I added, trying to
distract her from those thoughts. We all get them, but we can’t let them rule
our lives.

After another second of staring she blinked, sighed, and looked at me again.

“Okay, fine. No harm in that.”

Then, just as we started heading for the changing rooms, a Hork-Bajir burst out
of one of them.

Literally burst. Hork-Bajir are bigger than humans, a lot stronger, and a lot
sharper. The thin wooden walls separating the changing rooms never stood a
chance. Fortunately, the adjoining changing rooms were empty.

I guess I should back up a little and explain.

Earth is under attack from aliens called Yeerks. It has been for a couple of
years. But no one who has even the slightest chance of doing something about it
knows. Except for my friends and me, but our chances aren’t all that great,
either.

If I would just show you a Yeerk, you probably wouldn’t be very scared of it.
You’d be disgusted by it, maybe. They don’t look very impressive, they’re just
gray slugs. Somewhat larger than normal Earth slugs, but not enough to be
worried about it. You could easily squash it under your foot if you wanted to.

And if you knew what it was, you’d want to.

Yeerks are parasites. Sentient parasites. But they don’t just live off of other
beings like Earth parasites do. They live as them. Their little gimmick is that
they can get inside your head and control you. Literally inside. They enter
through your ears and then wrap themselves around your brain somehow. And
literally control. It takes them a couple minutes to figure out how your brain
works, but after that, their control is absolute.

With a Yeerk inside your head, you no longer control your arms or legs. You no
longer control your mouth or vocal cords. You no longer control what your senses
focus on. You become what we call a Controller.

You can still think for yourself though. The Yeerk can’t control that, not
directly anyway. But that just makes it all the more horrifying. Because that
means you know what’s going on. What the Yeerk is doing with your body. It could
make you hurt your friends and family, and laugh at you while it’s doing it. And
you can’t even look away.

You become the embodiment of helplessness.

But what it can’t control, it can observe. It can read all your thoughts,
memories, and emotions like an open book. That’s why I can’t tell you who I am.
Not only is there no good way for me to be sure that you’re not a Controller
right now, but even if I could be, the moment the Yeerks decide to target you
and make you one of them, they’ll know everything I told you.

And that goes for everyone. My neighbors could be Controllers. My teachers could
be Controllers. The police. The army. Even close family. So we keep this side of
our lives secret.

“But Rachel,” I’m sure you’re thinking, “I’m pretty sure I’d know if my mom or
dad was suddenly being controlled by an alien.” Think again. With access to
their minds, they can behave exactly like your mom and dad.

They don’t always do, of course. Just when you start feeling safe, think their
hosts are normal, they’ll start doing and suggesting things to work toward their
goal. To control every single human being, so they don’t have to fake anymore.
Then they’ll make Earth just like their home world. Destroy all that we humans
worked to accomplish. Kill every living thing that they don’t strictly need to
keep us alive. And then move on to the next species unfortunate enough to be big
enough to carry a Yeerk.

Yeerks do have one weakness. At least every three days, they need to leave their
host to swim around in what’s known as a Yeerk pool, to soak up nutrients and
Kandrona rays. If you can prevent a Controller from doing so, the Yeerk will
starve, and the host will be free again.

I’ve seen it. Jake was infested once after a mission. If it weren’t for Ax, we
wouldn’t even have realized before it was too late. But we did, and kept him
locked up in this abandoned shack out in the forest for three days straight. It
wasn’t exactly a pretty sight when the Yeerk finally gave in, but it sure was
satisfying.

Ax, by the way, is an Andalite. His full name is Aximili-Esgarrouth-Isthill.
Giving you his full name doesn’t really matter – Yeerks will attack any Andalite
on sight anyway. That is, if the Andalite gives them the chance.

Andalites look a bit like blue deer, but have a pair of human-like arms in
addition to their four hooved legs, a very alien head, and a deadly scorpion’s
tail. They have an astonishing amount of control over that tail of theirs. It’s
so fast that humans can hardly see it move, yet you won’t ever see one cut
anything that its owner wasn’t intending to cut. And their tail blade is very
sharp. If you get on an Andalite’s bad side, you won’t even know what hit you.
Even if you’re looking right at him.

You’ll also have a hard time sneaking up on one. Andalites have four eyes. Two
of them face forward, not dissimilar from human eyes. The other two are on
stalks above their head, like crab’s eyes. They constantly shift around,
independent of each other, scanning for possible threats.

You won’t hear an Andalite either if he doesn’t want you to. They can run very
quietly, and they don’t have to talk to communicate with one another. They don’t
even have a mouth to do that with; they just have two slits where a human mouth
would be. Instead, they communicate telepathically, and absorb nutrients through
their hooves.

Yeerks and Andalites hate each other indiscriminately. They’re at war. So, in a
way, that makes the Andalites the good guys of the galaxy. But they’re not
infallible. In fact, an Andalite called Seerow was the one who gave the Yeerks
spacefaring technology. Before the war, of course. He felt sorry for them.
You’ll have to ask Cassie to explain how anyone could pity those monsters. Pity
for Yeerks is not my strong suit.

The Andalites won’t be making that mistake again any time soon though. They
instated a law known as Seerow’s Kindness, forbidding them from giving any of
their technology to any other race. I guess the Andalites feel responsible for
the Yeerks because of Seerow, so they’re doing all they can to revert his
actions.

Unfortunately, they seem to be losing.

They lost, for instance, when they sent one of their great dome ships to help
Earth. And it’ll be at least another year or so before they can spare another
ship.

They were vastly outnumbered and slaughtered at a battle we witnessed on the
Leeran home world. Although they did manage to blow up most of the remaining
Yeerks with our help, so I guess you could call that one a tie.

But they definitely lost trying to protect the Hork-Bajir from the Yeerks. Now
there are very few free Hork-Bajir around. In fact, there used to be none for a
very long time, until an Ellimist intervened and used us to free two of them.
Ellimists are… hard to explain. They are virtually all-powerful, like gods, but
they say they can’t or won’t intervene with mortal affairs. They do, though. At
least one of them does. He wants to protect all forms of life from the Yeerks,
but he’s doing the absolute bare minimum to help. And he’ll deny doing even
that.

The Yeerks use Hork-Bajir as soldiers. They were a good choice for the job:
Hork-Bajir are almost as dangerous as Andalites. They have several horns and
blades protruding from their heavily armored bodies, feet like a tyrannosaurus,
and a beak that’s close to a falcon’s. In their natural form they’re actually
docile and not very smart, but that hardly matters now, because Yeerks are
smart, and are anything but docile.

So there we stood, frozen. Staring in disbelief at the sight of the Hork-Bajir,
the shattered changing rooms, the poor woman who happened to be changing two
stalls over, and the dark tunnel entrance that the Hork-Bajir exposed. There
must have been a secret entrance to the Yeerk pool underneath the city there. We
know there’s at least one other entrance like that in the mall, but I wouldn’t
have been casually shopping at this store if I’d known about this one.

Everyone else froze, too. Most people froze because it’s not every day you see
something as scary and obviously alien as a Hork-Bajir. Other people froze
because they know Hork-Bajir aren’t supposed to show themselves in broad
daylight, and there will be hell to pay for it later. Cassie and I froze mostly
because we weren’t sure initially if this Hork-Bajir was still a Controller, and
if so, if he was out here because the Yeerks found out about us and stopped
trying to be discrete.

Even the Hork-Bajir froze. I don’t know what he was expecting to happen after
escaping from the pool through a mall entrance, but apparently it wasn’t this.

The woman in the changing room was the first to start screaming. Then everything
just exploded. The Hork-Bajir blazed right past us toward the exit. Most people
panicked and ran off into random directions, but some just kept staring, and
some hesitantly started running after the Hork-Bajir.

Suddenly it was pretty clear who was a Controller and who was just in the wrong
place at the wrong time. It was also clear now that this was not in any way
planned by the Yeerks. Which means that the Hork-Bajir must have escaped while
his Yeerk was swimming around in the pool.

“We have to help him,” I heard Cassie say.

I wasn’t so sure about that. I mean, I wanted to help him, too. But he wasn’t
our problem either. Truth is, I wasn’t really sure what we could do to help him
right then, anyway. Two teens who have to hide their identity from the Yeerks
can hardly stand up to the hundreds of human- and dozens of Hork-Bajir-
Controllers that’ll soon be swarming around the mall.

Not that we’re entirely helpless. See, Ax isn’t the only Andalite who survived
the destruction of the dome ship. Ax’s brother, Elfangor, was still alive when
his ship crashed in the abandoned construction site near the mall. Cassie, Jake,
Marco, Tobias, and I just so happened to be cutting through there right then.

Elfangor was hurt in the crash, or maybe by the weapons fire that caused it. We
tried to help, but there wasn’t anything we could do. He was dying. Instead, he
helped us. Well, not exactly us specifically; ‘us’ as in humankind. With what
little time he had left, he told us all he could about the Yeerks. And then did
something that no Andalite had done since Seerow. He gave us some of their
technology.

Specifically, he gave us an ability that almost all Andalites have: the power to
morph. To change into any animal that you can manage to acquire through touch.

In case you’re wondering what good that does, well, try standing up to me when I
turn into a grizzly bear or an African elephant, or try figuring out that I’m
spying on you from a mile away as a bald eagle. We even get the same telepathic
thought-speak abilities that Andalites have while we’re in morph. Also, because
morphing is based on DNA, and DNA doesn’t get damaged when you get hurt,
morphing will heal you. That’s pretty important in our line of work.

There are a couple of limitations to morphing though.

First and foremost, you can’t stay in a morph for more than two hours at a time.
If you do, you get stuck. That’s what happened to Tobias. He got trapped in his
red-tailed hawk morph on one of our first missions. He’s since regained his
power to morph, even back to his old body; a reward from the Ellimist for
helping him to free those two Hork-Bajir that I’d talked about. But his hawk
body is now his natural form. So that means that he can only stay human for two
hours, or he won’t be able to morph ever again. And he wants to help us fight
the Yeerks, which he can’t do if he can’t morph.

Secondly, you can only morph skin-tight clothing. Shoes and loose clothes don’t
work. Since we can’t exactly go walking around in public wearing spandex
superhero suits, we always end up having to hide our clothing somewhere when we
have to morph. Usually we can retrieve it later, but not always.

Third, you can’t go from one morph directly to another. You have to go through
your natural form. Very inconvenient when you have to hide your true identity.
Morphing also isn’t instant. It takes at least a minute to do. And while you’re
doing it, you’re very, very vulnerable. That’s why we couldn’t just morph to
something big and dangerous right there and then.

All Elfangor had to do to give us our morphing abilities was to have us touch a
small blue box known as an Escafil device. We’d figured it got destroyed in the
explosions that followed soon after, but we recently recovered it. Well, David
did. But I don’t really want to talk about David. He brought out the worst in
me. Well, in all of us. We ended up having to maroon him on a small, deserted
island a mile or so off the coast, far enough away from civilization that no one
would hear his thought-speak screams. We’d first gotten him stuck in a rat
morph, so there’s no way for him to get out of there alive.

The alternative would have been to just end him. Because he was trying very hard
to sell us out to the Yeerks or just kill us himself. And he got way too close.

Anyway, just after Elfangor gave us our morphing abilities, the Yeerks showed
up. They don’t like leaving evidence behind.

It’s not a happy memory. I still get nightmares from it, even after all the
other stuff that I went through since, and I probably will for a very long time
yet.

We had to hide and watch helplessly as Visser Three morphed into some huge alien
and ate Elfangor alive.

Visser Three, the only Yeerk in existence to have ever succeeded in taking an
Andalite, morph-capable host.

Visser Three, the current leader of the Earth invasion.

Visser Three, who has tried to kill me and my friends more often than I care to
remember.

“Don’t just stand there, you idiots,” I heard a human voice behind us call.
“Visser Three will have us all for lunch if we don’t get that Hork-Bajir and get
this whole place on lockdown before half the city’s seen him!”

A Controller. He sounded desperate, and he was right to. Visser Three, who
frequently kills his subordinates, Yeerk and host alike, just to make a point.
We’ve seen him do it for much less important screw-ups than letting a Hork-Bajir
escape and free-roam around the mall.

We still just stood there. We watched as the Hork-Bajir ran out of the store –
not through the door, through a display window – into the Saturday afternoon
crowd of the mall plaza. The store’s clerks rushed out after him, while its
customers scattered out in various directions. The clerks must have all been
Controllers, the store being a Yeerk pool entrance and all.

As if all of that didn’t cause enough of a ruckus, the window shattering also
set off the burglary alarm of the store.

Suddenly, a hand on my shoulder! It jerked me around!

“Are you deaf?”

Time seemed to slow to a crawl. It was the Controller who I’d heard yell. He was
yelling at us, apparently. Behind him stood a whole contingent of armed
Controllers. A mix of humans and Hork-Bajir. They must have followed the Hork-
Bajir out through the Yeerk pool entrance, which we’d turned our backs to in
order to watch the escaping Hork-Bajir. Stupid!

They were all carrying Dracon beams. A handheld Dracon beam is about the size of
a pistol, but looks more sci-fi than that and shoots lasers that completely
evaporate what they hit. Or stun, they can do that too. But they don’t use that
setting very often.

My mind was racing, trying to decide between fight or flight. But neither would
really accomplish anything. They’d kill or infest us either way. Unable to make
a decision, I was completely frozen again. And I hated myself for it. Doing
something, anything, would have been better than doing nothing!

So that was it. We were done for. They’d realize we weren’t Controllers in no
time. Yet we’d clearly seen a Hork-Bajir before. I mean, all normal people had
run off by now. We were the only two idiots just standing there gawking at it.
And free humans aren’t supposed to see anything Yeerk-related.

He must have been able to read the shock and defeat from my face. If he
couldn’t, I’m sure Cassie’s face would have sufficed.

They’d force us down into the Yeerk pool and infest us. I’ve been down there
before, except that was on missions. Even when our plans backfired completely,
and they almost always did, we still had some degree of control. But this would
be different.

I’ve seen them do it. They would have two Hork-Bajir for each of us, dragging us
down to the infestation pier over the pool. Once there, they would kick us in
the back of our legs to force us to kneel down. Then they would push our heads
down into the pool. Finally, we’d feel the Yeerk slither into our ears.

And once we’d be made Controllers, they’d know who we are. They’d come for Jake,
Marco, Tobias, and Ax. Our families too, I’m sure, just to spite us. Maybe
they’d make us kill them ourselves. Or maybe they’d just make them hosts to the
lowliest of Yeerks, make them clean up their dirty work or something. Or just
torture them outright, and make us watch them break. Whatever they’d do, I’m
sure it wouldn’t be nice.

You have no idea just how much Visser Three hates us. And he’s not a forgiving
kind of being.

But then the man just shoved a Dracon beam in my hands and ran off after the
Hork-Bajir, along with the other human and Hork-Bajir Controllers from the Yeerk
pool.

He just gave me a weapon that no free human is ever supposed to get their hands
on. Just like that.

“Wh… Wha?” I managed to say when he was gone.

“Uhh,” Cassie affirmed, staring at the Dracon beam. Her face was as pale as it
could get.

“H-how about we just get out of here?” she stammered, and gingerly hung the
dress back on a nearby clothing rack. She was visibly trembling from the fear
and adrenaline rush.

So was I, actually.

“Y-yeah, good idea.”

                                   CHAPTER 2
                                   ---------

The situation outside the store can only be described as complete chaos. We
couldn’t see much of what was going on at first, with all the fleeing people in
the way. We only got a glimpse of the situation when we came to the stairs down
to the first floor.

A number of Hork-Bajir-Controllers were already surrounding the poor escapee.
There was no way he was going to get out of this alive without a Yeerk in his
head. Even with the Dracon beam, there wasn’t anything we could do for him. I
considered mercy-killing him with it, but there was no way I’d be able to hit
him from this distance. Not without risking hitting some innocent bystander,
anyway. I saw Cassie was looking at him helplessly.

“There’s nothing we can do for him, Cassie.”

“I know.”

Her voice was breaking up. Cassie’s a lot more sensitive than I am; this sort of
thing hurts her deeply. It’s not that I didn’t care about the Hork-Bajir at all
or something, but we’d have time to mourn him later.

Meanwhile, the mall exits were already being blocked by human Controllers. No
one was getting in or out. I couldn’t help but be just a little impressed at how
quickly they got the situation under control. They must have been preparing for
events like these.

The blocked exits completed the panic among all the free humans. People were
literally running head-on into one another, not knowing where to go.

“We’re never going to get out of here without being seen,” Cassie added.

“So we find a place to morph something big and go out fighting,” I said,
sounding more self-determined than I felt. I hadn’t exactly thought it through
yet, but my anger and hatred toward the Yeerks was starting to win over my other
emotions.

Like I said before, I don’t like showing my fear. I usually just get angry,
instead. It’s because of times like these that my friends think I’m Xena.

“I’ve a better idea,” Cassie said. “Come on.”

She pulled me along into the crowd, heading straight for the main exit. As we
passed the group of Hork-Bajir, we saw the escapee lie on the floor in a puddle
of his own blood. He was probably still alive though, because they were going
through the effort of cuffing him.

“Does your plan involve kicking Yeerk butt? Because that’s what I feel like
doing right now.”

“So do I, but we can’t fight here and win.”

I just groaned at that. She was right, of course.

“Just play along. We’re Controllers now.”

Wait, what? We’re Controllers now? Was she just giving up? No, that wasn’t
right. But then what…

There was no more time to think. Cassie was already forcing her way through the
crowd to the Controllers at the main entrance, and she was pulling me along.

“Let us through,” Cassie yelled at the first Controller she reached.

Oh, great plan, Cassie. Literally everyone around you had the same idea. The
Controller ignored her, of course.

“Listen, you idiot, we saw someone push his way through you guys just a minute
ago.”

She grabbed the Dracon beam from me and held it up in front of the Controller’s
face. Not threateningly, she was kind of just showing him we had it.

“Or would you like me to pass your incompetence on to Visser Three?”

Okay, no sarcasm now: that was actually smart. Dangerous, sure, but so was my
idea. Cassie can lie pretty convincingly when she has to, as long as it doesn’t
involve hiding her emotions. And the Controllers were all just as scared as we
were. Scared of Visser Three.

He let us through.

The situation outside wasn’t much less chaotic, but it was a whole lot safer.
Some people were running away, probably having heard the screaming or having
seen a glimpse of the Hork-Bajir from outside. Other people were casually
heading toward the sealed entrance of the mall, wondering what those people were
running from. A police car was just arriving at the scene, and I could hear more
sirens further away. Maybe they were Controllers, but more likely they were just
responding to the store alarm, or maybe people have just been calling 911. Who
knows?

We ran for the first empty alley that seemed far enough away for us to safely
catch our breath. Along the way, I opened my mouth a couple times to start
explaining my plan for dealing with the situation, but no plan came. At least,
no plan that was better than going in with elephant and rhino morphs to cause
enough extra chaos to let people escape. And that was a suicide mission. There
were so many armed Controllers in the mall now, that it was basically an
extension of the Yeerk pool.

We kind of just collapsed in that alley, as the adrenaline rush was starting to
wear off. We were silent for a while. Cassie was the first to speak.

“I wonder how the Yeerks are going to cover this up. They can’t infest everyone,
can they?”

She was trembling at the thought.

“I’m sure they’ll think of a way,” I growled. “We have to do something.”

We were both silent for a while again. I guess Cassie had also run out of good
ideas.

“I can’t believe that Controller just gave you his Dracon beam,” she finally
said.

I nodded. “We make for convincing Controllers, apparently.”

“Do you think they’ll be able to track it?”

I hadn’t thought of that. We know that the Yeerks can detect the presence of
materials that don’t belong on Earth. We once found the Yeerks spending a whole
lot of effort trying to secure what turned out to be an ancient Andalite toilet
that crashed on Earth decades ago. They couldn’t work out from orbit what it
was, but they weren’t taking any chances.

I groaned. “As much as I hate to do it, maybe we should just hide it here for
now. Then we’ll ask Ax if it’s safe to keep it and come back for it later.”

Cassie hid the Dracon beam underneath a nearby dumpster.

“We should also find a place to put our clothes,” she said. “We need a meeting,
like right now. Maybe someone else has a good idea.”

I knew what she meant. Morph into birds, then round up the others. I was already
starting to undress down to my morphing suit by the time she’d finished her
sentence. We always wear something skintight underneath our clothes nowadays,
like my black leotard. Just in case.

“Where do we meet? Do we go straight back to the mall?”

“Guess there’s no harm in that if we’re birds… Should probably do seagulls
though, so we don’t draw too much attention to ourselves.”

The Yeerks know we’re out here and that we can morph. Despite that, most Yeerks
aren’t that vigilant at looking out for oddly behaving animals, but Visser Three
always is. And with something like this going on, he’s sure to show up sooner or
later.

Fortunately though, the Yeerks think we’re Andalites. If they ever work out that
we’re mostly just a couple of human teenagers who call themselves the Animorphs,
this’ll all be over quickly. That’s why it’s important that they can’t find our
shoes and clothes along with the Dracon beam, should they be able to track it.

I found a dirty discarded shopping bag in a corner of the alley. “Better than
nothing,” I grumbled to myself, and put my shoes, clothes, and handbag inside.
Then I picked up Cassie’s shoes and clothes, which she’d just thrown on the
ground. She was already morphing. Then I grumpily shoved the bag behind some
garbage on the other side of the alley, and started to morph as well.

Cassie has a talent for morphing. She has some control over the order in which
her body parts change. Maybe it’s because she spends so much time with animals.

Cassie’s parents are both vets. Her mom works as a caretaker at The Gardens, a
mix of a theme park and a zoo. Cassie and her dad together run the Wildlife
Rehabilitation Clinic from their barn. They take in local injured wildlife and
try to nurse the animals back to health. As you might expect, The Gardens and
Cassie’s clinic are where we’d acquired most of our morphs.

Cassie had started with her wings. She always does that when she morphs a bird.
It makes her look almost like an angel. She’d do the rest of the bird’s features
one by one, and leave the shrinking for last.

Not me.

The first thing that happened to me was a beak shooting out of my lips. The
second thing was my eyes moving to the sides of my head. Cassie looked away. As
usual, it was not a pretty sight, even when you’re used to seeing it. It doesn’t
hurt though. Which is good, because if it would, it’d hurt like hell.

I saw the flesh on my legs and feet shrivel away to make place for talons with
my left eye, while seeing the sky above the alley with my right. I guess my head
was cocked sideways. Maybe the left side of my neck was shrinking faster than
the right side?

Seeing in two different directions at the same time hurt my brain. Until the
seagull’s brain joins mine, I won’t be able to make much sense of it. The
picture was already crispy clear, though. Birds have much better eyesight than
humans do.

And then I saw the ground come toward me. I would have jerked if I wouldn’t have
done this so often already. Shrinking feels like falling, yet never quite
hitting the ground. Like those nightmares where you’re running toward something
but never quite reach it completely. But you get used to it.

I was almost done morphing when the seagull’s mind kicked in. You always get the
instincts of the animal you morph into as part of the morph. That’s usually a
good thing, for instance because humans aren’t that great at flying. Sometimes
you even get some memories from the animal somehow.

But those instincts can be overwhelming. Especially the first time you morph an
animal. One time, I jumped into an alligator pit at The Gardens to save a boy
who fell in accidentally. I’d acquired the first alligator I could find and
morphed into it immediately, just barely hidden from the crowd, hugging the
walls of the enclosure. My plan was to stave off the other alligators, of
course, until the trainers would arrive. But in the end, the only reason I
didn’t chomp up that little boy myself right there and then was because fighting
for dominance with the other alligators was higher up my list of priorities.

With most new morphs, it only takes a couple minutes for our human mind to take
back control. It depends very much on the animal though. We never quite got over
the seagull’s instincts. But they’re not exactly dangerous, so I guess it’s more
that we’re usually just not really trying to contain them.

I shot up into the air as soon as I finished morphing. Out of the alley. I could
find much better food elsewhere.

Cassie must have had the same idea. She was already circling overhead by the
time I was done.

<There’s a guy eating fries only a block away!> she thought-spoke to me.

Fries? No way I was going to let her have them all to herself!

No, snap out of it. There are lives at stake here.

<I’ll go get Jake and Marco, you get Tobias and Ax. Okay?>

<No way, you just want the fries to yourself.>

                                   CHAPTER 3
                                   ---------

<I swear; only Rachel can go to the mall and leave with a Dracon beam. From a
100%-off clearance sale, no less!>

That was Marco. His preferred mode of communication is sarcasm. Especially when
we’re all nervous. Jake and I ignored him.

<Okay, that’s not one of my best. But you have to admit it was a little funny.>

The three of us had just arrived at the mall. Jake and Marco both live
relatively close by compared to Tobias and Ax, and Cassie would also have to
find them first, so she’d take a while longer than I had.

All three of us were in our seagull morphs. We perched down on a ledge of a
building opposite to the mall entrance.

All in all, I was only gone for maybe twenty minutes. Apparently that was enough
time for the police to completely surround and secure the mall. They put down
screens in front of the mall entrance windows to prevent people from looking
inside, and taped off the surrounding area. They clearly weren’t just responding
to 911 calls. They came prepared. This was the work of Controllers high up in
the police chain of command.

The police screens weren’t high enough to block our view, though. I could see
that almost everyone was down on the floor inside. Now, bird’s eyes are almost
infinitely better than human eyes, so even at this distance, and through the
dirty and reflecting windows, I could see that they were still breathing.
Unconscious, but alive. Stunned by Dracon beams, I guessed.

<The Yeerks seem to want everyone alive,> I said.

<Of course they do,> Marco said. <They can hardly go around killing everyone who
was in there that wasn’t a Controller, can they? It would be headline news all
over the world. They don’t want that kind of attention near a Yeerk pool
entrance.>

As much as Marco always gets on my nerves, he’s the best of us at figuring out
these sorts of things.

<But if they’ve stunned everyone with Dracon beams, everyone will realize
something weird is going on when they wake up…> I wondered out loud.

I realized what was happening, of course. I’m not that stupid. But I was really
hoping that Marco would have figured out a good reason for them to not do what I
was thinking they were going to do.

<They’ll need to make everyone a Controller before they leave, yeah.>

So much for that.

<We can’t let that happen,> Jake said. <There’s easily, what, five hundred
people in there? But we should wait for the others first. Let’s play seagull
around here for a while, and see what we can see.>

There was no discussion, we just obeyed. Jake is sort of the leader of the
group. Not that he wants to be, it’s just a natural thing. And that’s precisely
why he’s good at it. He knows that his decisions can mean life or death, so he
thinks them through as much as he can, and he’ll carefully weigh in our thoughts
and opinions when we share them. But he’ll also make a snap decision when he has
to. We won’t always agree, we won’t always understand at the time, but you need
someone like that in a group. Even Ax decided that Jake is his leader now, or
‘prince,’ as Andalites call it.

I let the seagull in me swoop down to the empty ground between the entrance and
the police-do-not-cross tape. It saw some discarded cookie crumbs and figured it
was better than nothing. Or well, I was forcing it to hang around the mall
entrance, otherwise it’d have flown right to the beach. There’s way better food
there.

While the seagull in me was picking at cookie crumbs, I listened in on the
conversations between the crowd and the police.

“What’s going on?” I heard some woman ask a policeman.

“There was an armed robbery at the jewelry store, ma’am. You’ll have to come
back later.”

“Oh my, was anyone hurt?”

“We can neither confirm nor deny that.”

So that was their excuse to the outside world. It’d explain the blood stains and
the damage well enough, I guess; the jewelry store was just one store over from
where Cassie and I’d been shopping. And they could even pass off the Hork-Bajir
as people in full-body suits to anyone who got a glimpse of them but got away.
People are like that. They’ll easily accept lies like that if they make more
sense than their own memories. Anyone stubborn enough to not believe the lie
wouldn’t be believed by anyone else.

<Oh man. Hork-Bajir are carrying people off to the Yeerk pool two at a time,> I
heard Marco in my head.

That’s bad. It wouldn’t take them long to get everyone inside that way, out of
our reach.

The Yeerks recently upped their security at the pool. They now have devices at
all the entrances that detect and destroy any life forms not registered in their
system, and robots flying around inside doing the same thing. The last time we
went in, we had to spend several days digging a tunnel down as moles to bypass
the entrances. Our tunnel intersected with a cave filled with bats, so we’d
acquired some of those to fly inside. But once there, the robots took us down
pretty fast. They’d shot a hole through one of my wings, and burned the other
clear off. I fell right into the Yeerk pool.

Fortunately, bats are too small to be infested. But I had to morph back to human
while still inside the pool, underneath the infestation pier, because my bat
body could hardly move anymore.

<And our good friend Visser Three is already here,> Jake said bitterly.

It just keeps getting better and better.

<We can’t wait for the others,> I said. <We have to get in there now, or
everyone will be a Controller by the time they arrive.>

<Do you have a plan, oh mighty Xena?> Marco asked me.

And suddenly one came to me. The beginning of one, anyway.

<We need to cut them off from the Yeerk pool. Blow up the tunnel with the Dracon
beam.>

<Oh man.>

It was not a happy memory for any of us. We’d escaped from the Yeerk pool that
last time by blowing up one of the tunnels. With us still in it. Shooting the
roof with a Dracon beam did the trick.

Cassie and Marco were still in battle morph, even. They had to morph to human
first to be able to morph back to mole and dig their way out. And we all had to
remorph the mole underground once before we found our way back to the bat cave,
in order to not be a mole forever. It had been the only way out.

<To do that, we have to get inside the tunnel first,> Jake noted. <What about
that Gleet BioFilter thing?>

That’s the name of the device that protects the entrance from unwanted DNA.

<If it works based on DNA, won’t they have it disabled now? Otherwise it’d fry
anyone they’d carry in there.>

<It could also be based on species rather than individual DNA,> Marco pointed
out. <It could still fry us if we go in as some animal.>

<Well, I have a Hork-Bajir morph…>

My morph was one of the two Hork-Bajir who the Ellimist helped us free. Or we
helped the Ellimist free. Whatever. We’d morphed them to help stage their
suicide, so the Yeerks would stop hunting them.

But we don’t like morphing anything sentient. At that point, what really
separates us from the Yeerks? The Hork-Bajir had consented to us morphing them
to help them then, but I don’t exactly have time to find her and ask if she’d be
okay with me using her body now. Still, I was pretty sure she would be okay with
anything that helps fight the Yeerks. Especially if it’s in part to avenge a
recaptured Hork-Bajir.

We were silent for a minute, thinking it through.

<You’ll need a distraction too, otherwise you’re never getting out of there
alive,> Jake said. <Unless you want to try the mole thing again.>

It was a rhetorical question. No, that I did not want to do again. Ever.

<So here’s what we could do. First, we find a place where we can get Rachel into
the mall safely and unseen, with the Dracon beam. She then morphs Hork-Bajir and
hangs out by the tunnel entrance like she belongs. Meanwhile, Marco and I morph
rhino in some alley and barge in through the main entrance. We have a nice
little chat with Visser Three, and tell him to leave these people alone and
cover it up with some chemical spill that causes mass hallucinations or
something. Otherwise we blow up his tunnel and make him do it anyway.>

<Yeah, sure,> Marco said. <Visser Three will totally eat that up. He’ll say,
“Oh, sweet Andalite bandits, I would have never come up with something as smart
as that myself! What would I ever do without you? That’s so much better than
just making everyone here a Controller, like I was going to do eventually
anyway!”>

<Marco, do you have a better idea?> I asked. He was starting to get on my
nerves.

<Yes. We could just walk away and let them have this one.>

<Seriously?> I raged. <What if your dad were in there?>

That shut him up. It was a low blow. His mom is a Controller. A very important
one at that, Visser One. We weren’t even sure if she was still alive then. She
might not have survived one of our previous missions.

<Rachel, that’s not helping,> Jake said, trying to calm the situation. Calming
Marco and me down is normally Cassie’s job.

<I hate the Yeerks as much as you do, Rachel,> he growled, clearly holding back.
<But we can’t go in here on a suicide mission. Not unless it deals with the
Yeerks permanently.>

<Well, I still say we do it,> I said defiantly.

<You always say that.>

<Jake?>

<Ugh, you know I hate it when you guys make me take decisions like that, right?
But these are a lot of new Controllers. Including all the mall staff, at least
from this shift. They’d have free reign over this place. Heck, they wouldn’t
even need any other Yeerk pool entrances anymore. So I have to side with Rachel,
unless we can think of a better plan. Let’s go look for a way in for Rachel
first. Then we can decide whether we go for it or not.>

                                   CHAPTER 4
                                   ---------

We found an open window leading to the kitchen of one of the restaurants at the
food court. It was opened far enough for me to crawl through using my rat morph,
and it was on the first floor, so we could easily drop the Dracon beam inside
first.

Since none of us had come up with any better idea, we decided to go for it. I
flew back to the alley where Cassie and I had left our things, demorphed, and
put my clothes back on. I’d have to just walk back to the alley with the kitchen
window, because the Dracon beam would be too heavy and too obvious to carry as a
seagull. So I put the Dracon beam in the shopping bag along with Cassie’s
clothes, and started walking back.

Man, I looked like a homeless person. My clothes were stained from the inside of
the shopping bag, and the bag itself wasn’t helping. But I didn’t stand out too
much. No one paid any attention to me as I went from alley to alley.

I hesitated when I got back to the kitchen window. Marco was right; this could
easily turn into a suicide mission for all of us. Then again, that goes for
pretty much every mission we go on.

No time to think about it. There’ll be plenty of time to do that during the
nightmares that are sure to follow. So I morphed to rat.

<Can you guys hear me? Are you ready?> I asked my friends before I went inside.

<We hear you, and we’re ready,> Marco responded. He didn’t exactly sound happy
about it, but when we decide to go for a mission, we all have to do our part,
even when we don’t agree with it. Marco understood that.

I could feel that his thoughts were distant, but they were still clear. We never
quite figured out the exact range of thought-speak, but it isn’t infinite.

<Okay, I’m in my rat morph, heading for the window now.>

I morphed back out as soon as I got inside, not giving my rat instincts time to
take over with all the tasty smells of an abandoned kitchen. Then I immediately
morphed Hork-Bajir.

Morphing in rapid succession like that is tiring like you won’t believe, but
sometimes it has to be done. I wasn’t going as fast as I could though. I knew
free lives were at stake, but I didn’t want to tire myself too much before the
action even started.

Fortunately, Hork-Bajir have great endurance. I didn’t feel as tired anymore
when the Hork-Bajir brain joined mine. But that was about the only thing I felt.
The smarter the being, the less powerful its instincts seem to be. And
fortunately we don’t get the conscious part of a morph’s brain.

I picked up the Dracon beam, then found my way through the kitchen to the food
court. From there, I could see the plaza, where the Hork-Bajir had lined up
their unconscious victims, and from where Visser Three was observing. He was in
his natural Andalite form. It’s hard to tell emotions from an Andalite face,
especially at such a distance, but it was a safe bet that he was not happy about
the situation.

<Hurry up,> I heard him yell at one of the Hork-Bajir as she was trying to pick
up one of the… wider people. <The longer this place stays locked down, the more
attention we draw to ourselves!>

Thought-speak can be directed to only those people who you want to hear it. Or
you can just shout to anyone in range. Visser Three almost always did the
latter. Someone as powerful as him doesn’t need to hide.

He could see me, so I had to fit in. I gingerly walked over to the closest
unconscious human I could find. There were so few people left! At least half of
the people who were in here had already been taken down. We’d wasted way too
much time already!

The person I found was a young girl. She was about my youngest sister Sarah’s
age. Her cheeks were still red and wet from crying before she was Draconed. I
accidentally cut her arm shallowly with my elbow blade as I picked her up.

<I’m so sorry about this,> I thought-spoke to her alone. She wouldn’t have heard
me, of course, unconscious and all. But I felt like I had to say something. If
I’d have had to use my human voice to say it, I’d have choked up for sure.

I started heading for the tunnel entrance. Fortunately, Visser Three didn’t
notice that I was carrying only one small person, and the other Hork-Bajir
didn’t care enough to draw Visser Three’s attention to them. There was no way I
was going to pick up any more people.

<I’m heading toward the tunnel entrance now!> I called to my friends. I suddenly
realized that if their distraction wouldn’t work, I was going to have to take
her down to the pool and let the Yeerks infest her.

Well, that was never going to happen. I’d die first, and if that wasn’t an
option, I’d sooner mercy-kill the girl than let them do that to her.

Would I, though? Would I kill some 9-year old girl? Someone’s daughter? Perhaps
someone’s sister? At least with a Yeerk inside her head, there’d still be hope
for her. Suddenly my own thoughts sickened me.

Stop thinking about it, Rachel. You have a job to do, and if you do it right,
you might still save this girl. Pay attention to what you’re doing.

As I refocused on the task at hand, I realized something was wrong. There were
no Hork-Bajir walking from the Yeerk pool back to the plaza. So where were they
coming from?

Of course! The other entrance! There’s two tunnels leading from the mall to the
Yeerk pool, and they were using both to avoid having to deal with oncoming
traffic. I’d have to knock out both of them to cut the mall off from the pool!

But it was too late to change the plan. I heard a loud crash coming from the
entrance as Jake and Marco’s rhinos ploughed right through it. I heard gunfire
from outside, too. But normal police handguns don’t do much against the thick
skin of a rhino.

<Andalites!> Visser Three yelled with utmost disgust, and everyone stopped.

<All Hork-Bajir report to the mall immediately!> he added. The Hork-Bajir around
me instantly dropped their victims and ran back. You don’t question Visser
Three’s orders unless you’re suicidal.

I guess I was a bit suicidal, going on this mission and all.

<Visser Three, I have a deal for you,> I heard either Jake or Marco say. It was
probably Jake, but I couldn’t quite tell. <How about you just let these people
go about their lives and cover this whole thing up with mass hallucinations, and
–>

<How about I just kill you right here and now!> Visser Three fumed. But I didn’t
hear any Dracon beams. He hadn’t given the order to fire yet.

Don’t get distracted by the distraction, Rachel! Do what you came here to do!
Get into position to at least destroy one of the tunnels!

I was almost at the tunnel entrance that the Hork-Bajir had escaped through. I
carefully laid the girl down on the floor.

<Because there’s only two of us here,> I heard Jake or Marco respond. <The other
four are in position at the Yeerk pool entrance, ready to blow it to pieces.>

‘The’ entrance. I hadn’t told my friends that the entrance which the Hork-Bajir
had escaped from wasn’t the one we knew about!

I bolted for the nearest tunnel entrance. Nuts to the biofilter. We’d decided
that it was probably best for me to not go through the entrance, just in case
the filter didn’t work the way we thought it did. None of us ever really
understand much of Ax’s technobabble, and he hadn’t been around to tell us
whether it’d kill me or not in this particular case. But I had to go through. I
wasn’t going to get the chance to blow up two tunnels if Jake’s attempt at
diplomacy didn’t work out. But I figured that the two tunnels might join into
one before they reach the Yeerk pool, so maybe I could blow up the common part.

I could’ve yelled at Jake and Marco that there are two entrances. But it
wouldn’t have done them any good now. It’d distract them from Visser Three, and
maybe I could still fix this.

I didn’t know whether Visser Three was silent because he was carefully
considering his options, not wanting to mess this up and lose us again, or
because he was directing his thought-speak now, but I didn’t hear him respond.

Doesn’t matter. Find the fork in the tunnels. I was already through the
biofilter (if there even was one there) when I snapped back out of my thoughts
and looked around me again. Still alive. That’s good.

<Rachel, blow up the tunnel!> I heard in my head suddenly.

No! I’m not in position yet! Unless… Unless I blow up the tunnel behind me and
double back through the other. If I could find it at all. I could get trapped in
the Yeerk pool.

But I had to do it. Jake and Marco could be counting on the distraction caused
by the explosion. So I took a shot and fired.

It just made a clean hole in the roof of the tunnel. I could see daylight shine
through it.

No!

I shot again. That time it worked.

I hauled. I almost got covered by rubble as a large section of the tunnel
collapsed. Still, a few dozen yards after the collapse, I figured, “what the
hell,” and took another shot behind me. More of the roof came hurtling down.
Enough to kill the lights in the remaining part of the tunnel, so all I could
see now was some faint light at the end of it. If there was a split ahead, I
might not even see it.

I ran for the light. It was coming from the huge cavern that houses the Yeerk
pool. When I emerged, I was greeted by a large amount of startled alien eyes,
wondering what had caused all the noise in the tunnel. I guess Visser Three’s
and Jake’s thought-speak didn’t reach all the way here, otherwise they’d have
realized.

I quickly looked around to get my bearings. Only a few yards to the left of me
was another tunnel opening. Both tunnels shared the same staircase down to the
pool area. There was a sparse line of Hork-Bajir walking up the stairs. The
other tunnel to the mall, it must be!

“Visser Three orders retreat!” I yelled with all my power. Hork-Bajir can speak.
Their own language isn’t quite as advanced as English, so most of the time
you’ll hear Hork-Bajir speak a mixture of English and their own. Now, I didn’t
know any Hork-Bajir words, so I just used as few English words as I could.
“Andalite bandits!” I added. That’s what the Yeerks call us.

It was the kind of rash thing that I always end up doing in cases like these.
The words left my mouth the millisecond I came up with them. I just wanted them
out of that tunnel so I could do what I had to do without getting cornered, but
there were a million ways in which that could have backfired. If they’d have
called my bluff, I’d have been done for.

But they didn’t. They believed me just long enough. Visser Three’s arrogance and
the fear he spreads among his underlings is going to be his downfall. No one
dares to question his orders, even if they’re passed on by someone else, and
even if they don’t make that much sense.

I stood there watching for a moment as four Hork-Bajir ran back out of the
tunnel and got in combat formation around the entrance, along with some other
Controllers that had heard me. Then I checked to make sure that the tunnel was
clear and made a run for it.

“Hey!” I heard a Controller yell at me.

“She could be one of the Andalites, shoot her!” another Controller called.

But they were too late. I’d already shot the tunnel entrance behind me, and it
collapsed just as he’d finished his sentence.

Except it didn’t. Not enough. I looked back a second later and saw them hop over
some rubble. They were after me!

TSEEEEEW, I heard. It wasn’t from my Dracon beam. It also wasn’t set to stun. It
cut a big, gaping hole clean through my torso.

I didn’t even feel any pain at first, but I fell. The nerves that used to
control my legs no longer existed. Neither did my Hork-Bajir equivalent of a
spine.

Only one thing I could still do. Shoot the ceiling behind me. Somehow, I
managed.

Together with the damage at the entrance, it was enough to bring down the whole
tunnel all the way from the Yeerk pool entrance to where I had fallen. There
must have been casualties. Human and Hork-Bajir hosts would have been buried
alive. And they couldn’t morph to mole to escape.

I realized that I’d been pinned, too. My legs were crushed under a huge boulder.
A layer of dirt had fallen over the rest of my body. I was so numb that couldn’t
really judge the weight of it.

The hole through my torso was big enough for the dirt to fall right through me
and cover my alien insides. I was feeling it now. There are no words to express
how much it stung. I was trying to scream, but there was no air left inside my
lungs. Or maybe it was just that the insides of my lungs were covered in dirt
now.

Remove the dirt, my mind raced. My right arm still worked and obeyed.
Fortunately, the layer of dirt was only about an inch thick. I blinked some of
it out of my eyes and saw with blurred vision that the tunnel ahead of me was
still intact. Not buried alive, then.

Dying though. Morph!

It wasn’t the first time that I’d morphed while half dead. It’s not easy. Your
mind just wants to fall asleep. It gets really hard to focus on anything, and
you need to focus on what you want to morph in order for it to work.

But Hork-Bajir are tough. I’d never realized just how tough until now.

While morphing, I tried to pull myself further into the tunnel. You can’t morph
if there is no room for the body that you’re morphing into, and my legs were
still crushed underneath the rocks. But I was stuck. I could feel that my legs
were already trying to change.

Remember how I mentioned that morphing doesn’t hurt? Now it did.

My torso had already healed enough to let me scream. It came out as a weird mix
of human and Hork-Bajir. I was going to lose my legs! And I wasn’t sure if
morphing back and forth would heal my human body.

Wait, lose my legs, that’s it!

With all my might, I started morphing back to the Hork-Bajir from that weird
half-way point. My Hork-Bajir torso came back mostly regenerated, but my legs
were obviously still crushed. I was still stuck. But I was Hork-Bajir again, and
at least I was no longer dying.

I grabbed the Dracon beam and pointed it back at my lower body. I was going to
have to swing the beam around while holding the trigger down to make sure that
it would cut my legs off completely. I rehearsed all the actions I’d need to
take a couple times down to the finest details, to make sure I wouldn’t mess it
up. Then I looked away, closed my eyes, and did it.

It didn’t hurt nearly as much as I’d expected it to. I guess I was in shock.

I pulled myself away from the boulder and started morphing human again. It was
exhausting beyond belief. Combined with the seagull to human to rat to human to
Hork-Bajir within five minutes thing that I’d pulled only, what, ten minutes
ago? It was too much. I wouldn’t be able to morph again anytime soon.

I had to get out. The Controllers would find me for sure if I stayed here.

I started heading down the tunnel. I could only manage a slow crawl at first,
but at least I had legs again. I was slowly walking by the time I got to the
exit.

BrrrrEEEEET! BrrrrEEEEET!

You have got to be kidding me.

“Unauthorized life-form detected.”

That stupid biofilter thing was still active in this tunnel?!

Adrenaline is one hell of a drug. It had already been flowing through me, but
that extra little bit was enough to get me focused again.

<You five! Check out that alarm!> Visser Three was back in range.

Simultaneously, I heard Jake call, <That alarm! It could be Rachel! Combat
morph. Go, go, go!>

BrrrrEEEEET! BrrrrEEEEET! “Unauthorized life-form detected.”

The secret entrance in front of me had shut the moment the alarm went off,
designed to trap whoever or whatever triggered the alarm.

“Shut your eyes tightly to protect against retinal damage from the Gleet
BioFilter.”

I shot my Dracon beam at the secret entrance while already charging at it. The
Dracon beam didn’t do as much damage as I’d hoped, but it was enough for my body
to burst out through it like the Hork-Bajir had. It hurt, but at least I was out
of range of the biofilter. Just as I got out, the clothing store in front of me
lit up from the blinding light that would have killed me if I hadn’t.

“Drop your weapon!”

Three Hork-Bajir and two human Controllers all had their Dracon beams levelled
at me.

“Go to hell!” was my carefully considered response.

I moved to point my Dracon beam at my closest target, and even managed to pull
the trigger before they shot me. I missed, though. I saw the ground coming for
me for a split-second before passing out.

                                   CHAPTER 5
                                   ---------

When I came to, everything was dark. I tried opening my eyes, but I’d already
opened them.

Trapped! Buried alive? No, no pressure on my body. This was different.

The ground beneath me was very uneven, but kind of soft.

I flailed madly around me. My left arm hit something cold. It gave way like the
ground, but there was something sharp there too. Not sharp enough to cut me,
though. Could it be a dead body? Was I lying on dead bodies?!

Get a grip, Rachel! And no screaming! Don’t let them know you’re awake!

I stopped flailing around, and took note of my other senses.

That smell! Oh man, that smell. It was horrible. Familiar somehow, but it was so
strong and I was still so dazed that I didn’t realize what it was at the time.

Voices outside, in the distance! Footsteps! They were coming! No, wait, they
weren’t coming closer. There was also a faint buzzing sound, like small insects.

What even happened back there? Did they stun me? Well, I guess that would’ve
made sense. Visser Three would rather catch us alive than kill us. Having more
morph-capable Controllers would be very valuable to the Yeerks, not to mention
that I’d lead them right to my friends.

I’d heard Jake thought-speak to someone other than me. So either he and Marco
made it out of the mall alive, or Marco was hurt but the others had shown up.
No, that couldn’t be, not enough time had passed. So both Jake and Marco had
still been alive. So they would have tried to save me, but obviously they
failed. They wouldn’t put me in a dark, putrid place like this.

Aah!

Something itchy was crawling around on my arm. I instinctively swatted it.

<Rachel? Are you awake in there?>

“Cassie?” I wondered out loud.

<We had to hide you somewhere close to the mall…> That was Jake. He sounded like
he was trying to apologize.

<I don’t think she realizes yet where she is,> Marco said. <I mean, she hasn’t
come out and tried to kill us yet.>

<Well, the coast is clear,> Tobias said. <So she can come out and morph now if
she’s awake.>

Suddenly it dawned on me. “Wait, am I in a dumpster?”

<There it is,> Marco added. <Well, it was nice knowing you guys.>

I thrust upward to push the lid of the dumpster away. I blinked at the blinding
light outside to let my eyes adjust. Then I remembered that I was still standing
in the dumpster and jumped out. I almost threw up while swatting away the bugs
and bits of rotten food that were all over me.

<Eww…> Marco said.

“You threw me in a dumpster?!”

I was actually more relieved than angry. I mean, I had almost been captured.
They threw me in that dumpster to hide me from the Yeerks.

Still, a dumpster?!

<Yeah, I’m not really digging this new look of yours, Rachel.>

I took a second to look around me. Ah, there they were. Four seagulls perched on
a railing of the building opposite to the dumpster. Only about three yards up. I
grabbed a piece of rotten food that was still stuck to my body and threw it at
them. Their bird instincts took over and they looked like they were going to
bolt, but they perched back down.

<See, I told you she’d try to kill us,> Marco said, sounding proud at his
prediction that I wouldn’t like waking up in a dumpster.

<You can be angry at us later, Rachel,> Jake said. <We all need to get out of
here, and you can’t be seen. They know what you look like. Morph.>

They know what I look like.

I froze as I realized what that meant. They were looking for me, now. Hunting
me. Not a group of anonymous Andalites, me.

<Rachel?>

They know what I look like, my mind echoed.

I wasn’t thinking straight. I wanted to flee, but there was nowhere to go. In
hindsight, I guess I was still a bit dazed from getting stunned.

<I believe the Yeerks to not be organized enough to find out who you are based
on what you look like alone,> Ax said. <Also, they may well believe that you
were an Andalite in morph, trying to bypass the Gleet BioFilter. It would have
worked if your human DNA had been registered in their system.>

<He’s right, Rachel. This is not the end of the world,> Cassie said, also trying
to calm me down. <Not yet,> she added grimly.

It took me a minute to gather my thoughts. They were right. It was bad, but
there were still ways out of this.

“Seagull?” I finally asked.

<Yeah,> Jake responded.

I started morphing, but I was having a hard time.

<Rachel, I hate to say this, but the Yeerks are still looking for you,> Tobias
said about a minute later, noticing that I’d hardly changed yet. He was looking
out for us from the sky. <You need to hurry.>

“I’m eggshausthed,” I said, with my mouth morphed part way. “Giwe me a
seghondh.”

<She’s exhausted, Tobias,> Cassie repeated for me.

<I can see that, but the Yeerks aren’t going to go easy on us because of that.>

Come on, Rachel, two more morphs. One to get out of here now, and one to become
human again later. You can do it. You have to.

It took me a couple minutes, much longer than it normally takes, but I
succeeded, and it cleared my mind a bit. When I joined Tobias in the air, I
realized why he was rushing me. The whole area was crawling with police and
searching Controllers now. Searching for me.

That meant we wouldn’t be able to get my clothes and handbag back for a while.
Great, there goes another set of clothes and literally all of my money.

I followed my friends to Cassie’s barn. On the way, Jake and Marco explained to
me what had happened from their perspective. Visser Three obviously didn’t take
their deal. He had silently ordered his subordinates to stun them. But rhinos
can take quite a beating. The stun setting of the Dracon beams simply wasn’t
powerful enough, so they managed to retreat.

The police had opened fire the moment they rushed into the mall and never really
stopped shooting at them. Rhinos have really thick skin, but even the low-
caliber bullets were starting to hurt. So they found an alley to demorph. Then
they morphed back to seagull and circled around the mall to look for me. They
were calling out to me at first, but I guess I was too far underground to hear
them. Ax suggested that the Yeerks might also have installed something that
blocks thought-speak from passing through the cave walls.

When the
